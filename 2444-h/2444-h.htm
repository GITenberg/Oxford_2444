<h2>PREFACE</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">These</span> papers do not profess even to
sketch the outlines of a history of Oxford.&nbsp; They are merely
records of the impressions made by this or that aspect of the
life of the University as it has been in different ages.&nbsp;
Oxford is not an easy place to design in black and white, with
the pen or the etcher&rsquo;s needle.&nbsp; On a wild winter or
late autumn day (such as Father Faber has made permanent in a
beautiful poem) the sunshine fleets along the plain, revealing
towers, and floods, and trees, in a gleam of watery light, and
leaving them once more in shadow.&nbsp; The melancholy mist
creeps over the city, the damp soaks into the heart of
everything, and such suicidal weather ensues as has been
described, once for all, by the author of
<i>John-a-Dreams</i>.&nbsp; How different Oxford looks when the
road to Cowley Marsh is dumb with dust, when the heat seems
almost tropical, and by the drowsy banks of the Cherwell you
might almost expect some shy southern water-beast to come
crashing through the reeds!&nbsp; And such a day, again, is
unlike the bright weather of late September, when all the gold
and scarlet of Bagley Wood are concentrated in the leaves that
cover the walls of Magdalen with an imperial vesture.</p>
<p>Our memories of Oxford, if we have long made her a Castle of
Indolence, vary no less than do the shifting aspects of her
scenery.&nbsp; Days of spring and of mere pleasure in existence
have alternated with days of gloom and loneliness, of melancholy,
of resignation.&nbsp; Our mental pictures of the place are tinged
by many moods, as the landscape is beheld in shower and sunshine,
in frost, and in the colourless drizzling weather.&nbsp; Oxford,
that once seemed a pleasant porch and entrance into life, may
become a dingy ante-room, where we kick our heels with other
weary, waiting people.&nbsp; At last, if men linger there too
late, Oxford grows a prison, and it is the final condition of the
loiterer to take &lsquo;this for a hermitage.&rsquo;&nbsp; It is
well to leave the enchantress betimes, and to carry away few but
kind recollections.&nbsp; If there be any who think and speak
ungently of their <i>Alma Mater</i>, it is because they have
outstayed their natural &lsquo;welcome while,&rsquo; or because
they have resisted her genial influence in youth.</p>

19</span>CHAPTER I<br />
<span class="GutSmall">THE TOWN BEFORE THE UNIVERSITY</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Most</span> old towns are like
palimpsests, parchments which have been scrawled over again and
again by their successive owners.&nbsp; Oxford, though not one of
the most ancient of English cities, shows, more legibly than the
rest, the handwriting, as it were, of many generations.&nbsp; The
convenient site among the interlacing waters of the Isis and the
Cherwell has commended itself to men in one age after
another.&nbsp; Each generation has used it for its own purpose:
for war, for trade, for learning, for religion; and war, trade,
religion, and learning have left on Oxford their peculiar
marks.&nbsp; No set of its occupants, before the last two
centuries began, was very eager to deface or destroy the
buildings of its predecessors.&nbsp; Old things were turned to
new uses, or altered to suit new tastes; they were not overthrown
and carted away.&nbsp; Thus, in walking through Oxford, you see
everywhere, in colleges, chapels, and churches, doors and windows
which have been builded up; or again, openings which have been
cut where none originally existed.&nbsp; The upper part of the
round Norman arches in the Cathedral has been preserved, and
converted into the circular bull&rsquo;s-eye lights which the
last century liked.&nbsp; It is the same everywhere, except where
modern restorers have had their way.&nbsp; Thus the life of
England, for some eight centuries, may be traced in the buildings
of Oxford.&nbsp; Nay, if we are convinced by some antiquaries,
the eastern end of the High Street contains even earlier
scratches on this palimpsest of Oxford; the rude marks of savages
who scooped out their damp nests, and raised their low walls in
the gravel, on the spot where the new schools are to stand.&nbsp;
Here half-naked men may have trapped the beaver in the Cherwell,
and hither they may have brought home the boars which they slew
in the trackless woods of Headington and Bagley.&nbsp; It is with
the life of historical Oxford, however, and not with these
fancies, that we are concerned, though these papers have no
pretension to be a history of Oxford.&nbsp; A series of pictures
of men&rsquo;s life here is all they try to sketch.</p>
<p>It is hard, though not impossible, to form a picture in the
mind of Oxford as she was when she is first spoken of by
history.&nbsp; What she may have been when legend only knows her;
when St. Frideswyde built a home for religious maidens; when she
fled from King Algar and hid among the swine, and after a whole
fairy tale of adventures died in great sanctity, we cannot even
guess.&nbsp; This legend of St. Frideswyde, and of her
foundation, the germ of the Cathedral and of Christ Church, is
not, indeed, without its value and significance for those who
care for Oxford.&nbsp; This home of religion and of learning was
a home of religion from the beginning, and her later life is but
a return, after centuries of war and trade, to her earliest
purpose.&nbsp; What manner of village of wooden houses may have
surrounded the earliest rude chapels and places of prayer, we
cannot readily guess, but imagination may look back on Oxford as
she was when the <i>English Chronicle</i> first mentions
her.&nbsp; Even then it is not unnatural to think Oxford might
well have been a city of peace.&nbsp; She lies in the very centre
of England, and the Northmen, as they marched inland, burning
church and cloister, must have wandered long before they came to
Oxford.&nbsp; On the other hand, the military importance of the
site must have made it a town that would be eagerly contended
for.&nbsp; Any places of strength in Oxford would command the
roads leading to the north and west, and the secure, raised paths
that ran through the flooded fens to the ford or bridge, if
bridge there then was, between Godstowe and the later Norman
<i>grand pont</i>, where Folly Bridge now spans the Isis.&nbsp;
Somewhere near Oxford, the roads that ran towards Banbury and the
north, or towards Bristol and the west, would be obliged to cross
the river.&nbsp; The water-way, too, and the paths by the
Thames&rsquo; side, were commanded by Oxford.&nbsp; The Danes, as
they followed up the course of the Thames from London, would be
drawn thither, sooner or later, and would covet a place which is
surrounded by half a dozen deep natural moats.&nbsp; Lastly,
Oxford lay in the centre of England indeed, but on the very
marches of Mercia and Wessex.&nbsp; A border town of natural
strength and of commanding situation, she can have been no mean
or poor collection of villages in the days when she is first
spoken of, when Eadward the Elder &lsquo;incorporated with his
own kingdom the whole Mercian lands on both sides of Watling
Street&rsquo; (Freeman&rsquo;s <i>Norman Conquest</i>, vol. i. p.
57), and took possession of London and of Oxford as the two most
important parts of a scientific frontier.&nbsp; If any man had
stood, in the days of Eadward, on the hill that was not yet
&lsquo;Shotover,&rsquo; and had looked along the plain to the
place where the grey spires of Oxford are clustered now, as it
were in a purple cup of the low hills, he would have seen little
but &lsquo;the smoke floating up through the oakwood and the
coppice,&rsquo;</p>

<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&Kappa;&alpha;&pi;&nu;&#8056;&nu;

&#8021;&lambda;&eta;&nu;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The low hills were not yet cleared, nor the fens and the wolds
trimmed and enclosed.&nbsp; Centuries later, when the early
students came, they had to ride &lsquo;through the thick forest
and across the moor, to the East Gate of the city&rsquo;
(<i>Munimenta Academica</i>, Oxon., vol. i. p. 60).&nbsp; In the
midst of a country still wild, Oxford was already no mean city;
but the place where the hostile races of the land met to settle
their differences, to feast together and forget their wrongs over
the mead and ale, or to devise treacherous murder, and close the
banquet with fire and sword.</p>
<p>Again and again, after Eadward the Elder took Mercia, the
Danes went about burning and wasting England.&nbsp; The wooden
towns were flaming through the night, and sending up a thick
smoke through the day, from Thamesmouth to Cambridge.&nbsp;
&lsquo;And next was there no headman that force would gather, and
each fled as swift as he might, and soon was there no shire that
would help another.&rsquo;&nbsp; When the first fury of the
plundering invaders was over, when the Northmen had begun to wish
to settle and till the land and have some measure of peace, the
early meetings between them and the English rulers were held in
the border-town, in Oxford.&nbsp; Thus Sigeferth and Morkere,
sons of Earngrim, came to see Eadric in Oxford, and there were
slain at a banquet, while their followers perished in the attempt
to avenge them.&nbsp; &lsquo;Into the tower of St. Frideswyde
they were driven, and as men could not drive them thence, the
tower was fired, and they perished in the burning.&rsquo;&nbsp;
So says William of Malmesbury, who, so many years later, read the
story, as he says, in the records of the Church of St.
Frideswyde.&nbsp; There is another version of the story in the
<i>Codex Diplomaticus</i> (<span
class="GutSmall">DCCIX.</span>).&nbsp; Aethelred is made to say,
in a deed of grant of lands to St. Frideswyde&rsquo;s Church
(&lsquo;mine own minster&rsquo;), that the Danes were slain in
the massacre of St. Brice.&nbsp; On that day Aethelred, &lsquo;by
the advice of his satraps, determined to destroy the tares among
the wheat, the Danes in England.&rsquo;&nbsp; Certain of these
fled into the minster, as into a fortress, and therefore it was
burned and the books and monuments destroyed.&nbsp; For this
cause Aethelred gives lands to the minster, &lsquo;fro Charwell
brigge andlong the streame, fro Merewell to Rugslawe, fro the
lawe to the foule putte,&rsquo; and so forth.&nbsp; It is
pleasant to see how old are the familiar names
&lsquo;Cherwell,&rsquo; &lsquo;Hedington,&rsquo;
&lsquo;Couelee&rsquo; or Cowley, where the college
cricket-grounds are.&nbsp; Three years passed, and the headmen of
the English and of the Danes met at Oxford again, and more
peacefully, and agreed to live together, obedient to the laws of
Eadgar; to the law, that is, as it was administered in older
days, that seem happier and better ruled to men looking back on
them from an age of confusion and bloodshed.&nbsp; At Oxford,
too, met the peaceful gathering of 1035, when Danish and English
claims were in some sort reconciled, and at Oxford Harold
Harefoot, the son of Cnut, died in March 1040.&nbsp; The place
indeed was fatal to kings, for St. Frideswyde, in her anger
against King Algar, left her curse on it.&nbsp; Just as the old
Irish kings were forbidden by their customs to do this or that,
to cross a certain moor on May morning, or to listen to the
winnowing of the night-fowl&rsquo;s wings in the dusk above the
lake of Tara; so the kings of England shunned to enter Oxford,
and to come within the walls of Frideswyde the maiden.&nbsp;
Harold died there, as we have seen, but there he was not
buried.&nbsp; His body was laid at Westminster, where it could
not rest, for his enemies dug it up, and cast it forth upon the
fens, or threw it into the river.&nbsp; Many years later, when
Henry <span class="GutSmall">III.</span> entered Oxford, not
without fear, the curse of Frideswyde lighted also upon
him.&nbsp; He came in 1263, with Edward the prince, and
misfortune fell upon him, so that his barons defeated and took
him prisoner at the battle of Lewes.&nbsp; The chronicler of
Oseney Abbey mentions his contempt of superstitions, and how he
alone of English kings entered the city: &lsquo;<i>Quod nullus
rex attemptavit a tempore Regis Algari</i>,&rsquo; an error, for
Harold <i>attemptavit</i>, and died.&nbsp; When Edward I. was
king, he was less audacious than his father, and in 1275 he rode
up to the East Gate and turned his horse&rsquo;s head about, and
sought a lodging outside the town, <i>reflexis habenis equitans
extra moenia aulam regiain in suburbio positam
introivit</i>.&nbsp; In 1280, however, he seems to have plucked
up courage and attended a Chapter of Dominicans in Oxford.</p>
<p>The last of the meetings between North and South was held at
Oxford in October 1065.&nbsp; &lsquo;<i>In urle qu&aelig; famoso
nomine Oxnaford nuncupatur</i>,&rsquo; to quote a document of
Cnut&rsquo;s.&nbsp; (<i>Cod. Dipl.</i> <span
class="GutSmall">DCCXLVI</span>. in 1042.)&nbsp; There the
Northumbrian rebels met Harold in the last days of Edward the
Confessor.&nbsp; With this meeting we leave that Oxford before
the Conquest, of which possibly not one stone, or one rafter,
remains.&nbsp; We look back through eight hundred years on a
city, rich enough, it seems, and powerful, and we see the narrow
streets full of armed bands of men&mdash;men that wear the
cognisance of the horse or of the raven, that carry short swords,
and are quick to draw them; men that dress in short kirtles of a
bright colour, scarlet or blue; that wear axes slung on their
backs, and adorn their bare necks and arms with collars and
bracelets of gold.&nbsp; We see them meeting to discuss laws and
frontiers, and feasting late when business is done, and
chaffering for knives with ivory handles, for arrows, and
saddles, and wadmal, in the booths of the citizens.&nbsp; Through
the mist of time this picture of ancient Oxford may be
distinguished.&nbsp; We are tempted to think of a low, grey
twilight above that wet land suddenly lit up with fire; of the
tall towers of St. Frideswyde&rsquo;s Minster flaring like a
torch athwart the night; of poplars waving in the same wind that
drives the vapour and smoke of the holy place down on the Danes
who have taken refuge there, and there stand at bay against the
English and the people of the town.&nbsp; The material Oxford of
our times is not more unlike the Oxford of low wooden booths and
houses, and of wooden spires and towers, than the life led in its
streets was unlike the academic life of to-day.&nbsp; The
Conquest brought no more quiet times, but the whole city was
wrecked, stormed, and devastated, before the second period of its
history began, before it was the seat of a Norman stronghold, and
one of the links of the chain by which England was bound.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Four hundred and seventy-eight houses were so ruined as to
be unable to pay taxes,&rsquo; while, &lsquo;within the town or
without the wall, there were but two hundred and forty-three
houses which did yield tribute.&rsquo;</p>
<p>With the buildings of Robert D&rsquo;Oily, a follower of the
Conqueror&rsquo;s, and the husband of an English wife, the
heiress of Wigod of Wallingford, the new Oxford begins.&nbsp;
Robert&rsquo;s work may be divided roughly into two
classes.&nbsp; First, there are the strong places he erected to
secure his possessions, and, second, the sacred places he erected
to secure the pardon of Heaven for his robberies.&nbsp; Of the
castle, and its &lsquo;shining coronal of towers,&rsquo; only one
tower remains.&nbsp; From the vast strength of this picturesque
edifice, with the natural moat flowing at its feet, we may guess
what the castle must have been in the early days of the Conquest,
and during the wars of Stephen and Matilda.&nbsp; We may guess,
too, that the burghers of Oxford, and the rustics of the
neighbourhood, had no easy life in those days, when, as we have
seen, the town was ruined, and when, as the extraordinary
thickness of the walls of its remaining tower demonstrates, the
castle was built by new lords who did not spare the forced labour
of the vanquished.&nbsp; The strength of the position of the
castle is best estimated after viewing the surrounding country
from the top of the tower.&nbsp; Through the more modern
embrasures, or over the low wall round the summit, you look up
and down the valley of the Thames, and gaze deep into the folds
of the hills.&nbsp; The prospect is pleasant enough, on an autumn
morning, with the domes and spires of modern Oxford breaking,
like islands, through the sea of mist that sweeps above the roofs
of the good town.&nbsp; In the old times, no movement of the
people who had their fastnesses in the fens, no approach of an
army from any direction could have evaded the watchman.&nbsp; The
towers guarded the fords and the bridge and were themselves
almost impregnable, except when a hard winter made the Thames,
the Cherwell, and the many deep and treacherous streams passable,
as happened when Matilda was beleaguered in Oxford.&nbsp; This
natural strength of the site is demonstrated by the vast mound
within the castle walls, which tradition calls the Jews&rsquo;
Mound, but which is probably earlier than the Norman
buildings.&nbsp; Some other race had chosen the castle site for
its fortress in times of which we know nothing.&nbsp; Meanwhile,
some of the practical citizens of Oxford wish to level the
Jews&rsquo; Mound, and to &lsquo;utilise&rsquo; the gravel of
which it is largely composed.&nbsp; There is nothing to be said
against this economic project which could interest or affect the
persons who entertain it.&nbsp; M. Brunet-Debaines&rsquo;
illustration shows the mill on a site which must be as old as the
tower.&nbsp; Did the citizens bring their corn to be tolled and
ground at the lord&rsquo;s mill?</p>
<p>Though Robert was bent on works of war, he had a nature
inclined to piety, and, his piety beginning at home, he founded
the church of St. George within the castle.&nbsp; The crypt of
the church still remains, and is not without interest for persons
who like to trace the changing fortunes of old buildings.&nbsp;
The site of Robert&rsquo;s Castle is at present occupied by the
County Gaol.&nbsp; When you have inspected the tower (which does
not do service as a dungeon) you are taken, by the courtesy of
the Governor, to the crypt, and satisfy your arch&aelig;ological
curiosity.&nbsp; The place is much lower, and worse lighted, than
the contemporary crypt of St. Peter&rsquo;s-in-the-East, but not,
perhaps, less interesting.&nbsp; The square-headed capitals have
not been touched, like some of those in St. Peter&rsquo;s, by a
later chisel.&nbsp; The place is dank and earthy, but otherwise
much as Robert D&rsquo;Oily left it.&nbsp; There is an
odd-looking arrangement of planks on the floor.&nbsp; It is
<i>the new drop</i>, which is found to work very well, and gives
satisfaction to the persons who have to employ it.&nbsp; Sinister
the Norman castle was in its beginning, &lsquo;it was from the
castle that men did wrong to the poor around them; it was from
the castle that they bade defiance to the king, who, stranger and
tyrant as he might be, was still a protector against smaller
tyrants.&rsquo;&nbsp; Sinister the castle remains; you enter it
through ironed and bolted doors, you note the prisoners at their
dreary exercises, and, when you have seen the engines of the law
lying in the old crypt you pass out into the place of
execution.&nbsp; Here, in a corner made by Robert&rsquo;s tower
and by the wall of the prison, is a dank little quadrangle.&nbsp;
The ground is of the yellow clay and gravel which floors most
Oxford quadrangles.&nbsp; A few letters are scratched on the soft
stone of the wall&mdash;the letters &lsquo;H. R.&rsquo; are the
freshest.&nbsp; These are the initials of the last man who
suffered death in this corner&mdash;a young rustic who had
murdered his sweetheart.&nbsp; &lsquo;H. R.&rsquo; on the prison
wall is all his record, and his body lies under your feet, and
the feet of the men who are to die here in after days pass over
his tomb.&nbsp; It is thus that malefactors are buried,
&lsquo;within the walls of the gaol.&rsquo;</p>
<p>One is glad enough to leave the remains of Robert&rsquo;s
place of arms&mdash;as glad as Matilda may have been when
&lsquo;they let her down at night from the tower with ropes, and
she stole out, and went on foot to Wallingford.&rsquo;&nbsp;
Robert seems at first to have made the natural use of his
strength.&nbsp; &lsquo;Rich he was, and spared not rich or poor,
to take their livelihood away, and to lay up treasures for
himself.&rsquo;&nbsp; He stole the lands of the monks of
Abingdon, but of what service were moats, and walls, and
dungeons, and instruments of torture, against the powers that
side with monks?</p>
<p>The <i>Chronicle of Abingdon</i> has a very diverting account
of Robert&rsquo;s punishment and conversion.&nbsp; &lsquo;He
filched a certain field without the walls of Oxford that of right
belonged to the monastery, and gave it over to the soldiers in
the castle.&nbsp; For which loss the brethren were greatly
grieved&mdash;the brethren of Abingdon.&nbsp; Therefore, they
gathered in a body before the altar of St. Michael&mdash;the very
altar that St. Dunstan the archbishop dedicated&mdash;and cast
themselves weeping on the ground, accusing Robert D&rsquo;Oily,
and praying that his robbery of the monastery might be avenged,
or that he might be led to make atonement.&rsquo;&nbsp; So, in a
dream, Robert saw himself taken before Our Lady by two brethren
of Abingdon, and thence carried into the very meadow he had
coveted, where &lsquo;most nasty little boys,&rsquo;
<i>turpissimi pueri</i>, worked their will on him.&nbsp; Thereon
Robert was terrified and cried out, and wakened his wife, who
took advantage of his fears, and compelled him to make
restitution to the brethren.</p>
<p>After this vision, Robert gave himself up to pampering the
monastery and performing other good works.&nbsp; He it was who
built a bridge over the Isis, and he restored the many ruined
parish churches in Oxford&mdash;churches which, perhaps, he and
his men had helped to ruin.&nbsp; The tower of St.
Michael&rsquo;s, in &lsquo;the Corn,&rsquo; is said to be of his
building; perhaps he only &lsquo;restored&rsquo; it, for it is in
the true primitive style&mdash;gaunt, unadorned, with
round-headed windows, good for shooting from with the bow.&nbsp;
St. Michael&rsquo;s was not only a church, but a watchtower of
the city wall; and here the old northgate, called Bocardo,
spanned the street.&nbsp; The rooms above the gate were used till
within quite recent times, and the poor inmates used to let down
a greasy old hat from the window in front of the passers-by, and
cry, &lsquo;Pity the Bocardo birds&rsquo;:</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Pigons qui sont en l&rsquo;essoine,<br />
Enserrez soubz trappe voli&egrave;re,&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>as a famous Paris student, Fran&ccedil;ois Villon, would have
called them.&nbsp; Of Bocardo no trace remains, but St.
Michael&rsquo;s is likely to last as long as any edifice in
Oxford.&nbsp; Our illustrations represent it as it was in the
last century.&nbsp; The houses huddle up to the church, and hide
the lines of the tower.&nbsp; Now it stands out clear, less
picturesque than it was in the time of Bocardo prison.&nbsp;
Within the last two years the windows have been cleared, and the
curious and most archaic pillars, shaped like balustrades, may be
examined.&nbsp; It is worth while to climb the tower and remember
the times when arrows were sent like hail from the narrow windows
on the foes who approached Oxford from the north, while prayers
for their confusion were read in the church below.</p>
<p>That old Oxford of war was also a trading town.&nbsp; Nothing
more than the fact that it was a favourite seat of the Jews is
needed to prove its commercial prosperity.&nbsp; The Jews,
however, demand a longer notice in connection with the still
unborn University.&nbsp; Meanwhile, it may be remarked that
Oxford trade made good use of the river.&nbsp; The <i>Abingdon
Chronicle</i> (ii. 129) tells us that &lsquo;from each barque of
Oxford city, which makes the passage by the river Thames past
Abingdon, a hundred herrings must yearly be paid to the
cellarer.&nbsp; The citizens had much litigation about land and
houses with the abbey, and one Roger Maledoctus (perhaps a very
early sample of the pass-man) gave Abingdon tenements within the
city.&rsquo;&nbsp; Thus we leave the pre-Academic Oxford a
flourishing town, with merchants and moneylenders.&nbsp; As for
the religious, the brethren of St. Frideswyde had lived but
loosely (<i>pro libito viverunt</i>), says William of Malmesbury,
and were to be superseded by regular canons, under the headship
of one Guimond, and the patronage of the Bishop of
Salisbury.&nbsp; Whoever goes into Christ Church new buildings
from the river-side, will see, in the old edifice facing him, a
certain bulging in the wall.&nbsp; That is the mark of the
pulpit, whence a brother used to read aloud to the brethren in
the refectory of St. Frideswyde.&nbsp; The new leaven of learning
was soon to ferment in an easy Oxford, where men lived <i>pro
libito</i>, under good lords, the D&rsquo;Oilys, who loved the
English, and built, not churches and bridges only, but the great
and famous Oseney Abbey, beyond the church of St. Thomas, and not
very far from the modern station of the Great Western
Railway.&nbsp; Yet even after public teaching in Oxford certainly
began, after Master Robert Puleyn lectured in divinity there
(1133; cf. <i>Oseney Chronicle</i>), the tower was burned down by
Stephen&rsquo;s soldiery in 1141 (<i>Oseney Chronicle</i>, p.
24).</p>

43</span>CHAPTER II<br />
<span class="GutSmall">THE EARLY STUDENTS&mdash;A DAY WITH A
MEDIEVAL UNDERGRADUATE</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Oxford</span>, some one says, &lsquo;is
bitterly historical.&rsquo;&nbsp; It is difficult to escape the
fanaticism of Antony Wood, and of &lsquo;our antiquary,&rsquo;
Bryan Twyne, when one deals with the obscure past of the
University.&nbsp; Indeed, it is impossible to understand the
strange blending of new and old at Oxford&mdash;the old names
with the new meanings&mdash;if we avert our eyes from what is
&lsquo;bitterly historical.&rsquo;&nbsp; For example, there is in
most, perhaps in all, colleges a custom called
&lsquo;collections.&rsquo;&nbsp; On the last days of term
undergraduates are called into the Hall, where the Master and the
Dean of the Chapel sit in solemn state.&nbsp; Examination papers
are set, but no one heeds them very much.&nbsp; The real ordeal
is the awful interview with the Master and the Dean.&nbsp; The
former regards you with the eyes of a judge, while the Dean says,
&lsquo;Master, I am pleased to say that Mr. Brown&rsquo;s
<i>papers</i> are very fair, very fair.&nbsp; But in the matters
of <i>chapels</i> and of <i>catechetics</i>, Mr. Brown
sets&mdash;for a <i>scholar</i>&mdash;a very bad example to the
other undergraduates.&nbsp; He has only once attended divine
service on Sunday morning, and on that occasion, Master, his
dress consisted exclusively of a long great-coat and a pair of
boots.&rsquo;&nbsp; After this accusation the Master will turn to
the culprit and observe, with emphasis ill represented by
italics, &lsquo;Mr. Brown, the <i>College</i> cannot hear with
pleasure of such behaviour on the part of a <i>scholar</i>.&nbsp;
You are <i>gated</i>, Mr. Brown, for the first fortnight of next
term.&rsquo;&nbsp; Now why should this tribunal of the Master and
the Dean, and this dread examination, be called
collections?&nbsp; Because (<i>Munimenta Academica</i>, Oxon., i.
129) in 1331 a statute was passed to the effect that &lsquo;every
scholar shall pay at least twelve pence a-year for lectures in
logic, and for physics eighteenpence a-year,&rsquo; and that
&lsquo;all Masters of Arts except persons of royal or noble
family, shall be obliged to <i>collect</i> their salary from the
scholars.&rsquo;&nbsp; This <i>collection</i> would be made at
the end of term; and the name survives, attached to the solemn
day of doom we have described, though the college dues are now
collected by the bursar at the beginning of each term.</p>
<p>By this trivial example the perversions of old customs at
Oxford are illustrated.&nbsp; To appreciate the life of the
place, then, we must glance for a moment at the growth of the
University.&nbsp; As to its origin, we know absolutely
nothing.&nbsp; That Master Puleyn began to lecture there in 1133
we have seen, and it is not likely that he would have chosen
Oxford if Oxford had possessed no schools.&nbsp; About these
schools, however, we have no information.&nbsp; They may have
grown up out of the seminary which, perhaps, was connected with
St. Frideswyde&rsquo;s, just as Paris University may have had
some connection with &lsquo;the School of the
Palace.&rsquo;&nbsp; Certainly to Paris University the academic
corporation of Oxford, the <i>Universitas</i>, owed many of her
regulations; while, again, the founder of the college system,
Walter de Merton (who visited Paris in company with Henry <span
class="GutSmall">III.</span>), may have compared ideas with
Robert de Sorbonne, the founder of the college of that
name.&nbsp; In the early Oxford, however, of the twelfth and most
of the thirteenth centuries, colleges with their statutes were
unknown.&nbsp; The University was the only corporation of the
learned, and she struggled into existence after hard fights with
the town, the Jews, the Friars, the Papal courts.&nbsp; The
history of the University begins with the thirteenth
century.&nbsp; She may be said to have come into being as soon as
she possessed common funds and rents, as soon as fines were
assigned, or benefactions contributed to the maintenance of
scholars.&nbsp; Now the first recorded fine is the payment of
fifty-two shillings by the townsmen of Oxford as part of the
compensation for the hanging of certain clerks.&nbsp; In the year
1214 the Papal Legate, in a letter to his &lsquo;beloved sons in
Christ, the burgesses of Oxford,&rsquo; bade them excuse the
&lsquo;scholars studying in Oxford&rsquo; half the rent of their
halls, or hospitia, for the space of ten years.&nbsp; The
burghers were also to do penance, and to feast the poorer
students once a year; but the important point is, that they had
to pay that large yearly fine &lsquo;propter suspendium
clericorum&rsquo;&mdash;all for the hanging of the clerks.&nbsp;
Twenty-six years after this decision of the Legate, Robert
Grossteste, the great Bishop of Lincoln, organised the payment
and distribution of the fine, and founded the first of the
<i>chests</i>, the chest of St. Frideswyde.&nbsp; These
<i>chests</i> were a kind of Mont de Pi&eacute;t&eacute;, and to
found them was at first the favourite form of benefaction.&nbsp;
Money was left in this or that <i>chest</i>, from which students
and masters would borrow, on the security of pledges, which were
generally books, cups, daggers, and so forth.</p>

</a></p>
<p>Now, in this affair of 1214 we have a strange passage of
history, which happily illustrates the growth of the
University.&nbsp; The beginning of the whole affair was the
quarrel with the town, which, in 1209, had hanged two clerks,
&lsquo;in contempt of clerical liberty.&rsquo;&nbsp; The matter
was taken up by the Legate&mdash;in those bad years of King John
the Pope&rsquo;s viceroy in England&mdash;and out of the
humiliation of the town the University gained money, privileges,
and halls at low rental.&nbsp; These were precisely the things
that the University wanted.&nbsp; About these matters there was a
constant strife, in which the Kings, as a rule, took part with
the University.&nbsp; The University possessed the legal
knowledge, which the monarchs liked to have on their side, and
was therefore favoured by them.&nbsp; Thus, in 1231 (Wood,
<i>Annals</i>, i. 205), &lsquo;the King sent out his Breve to the
Mayor and Burghers commanding them not to overrate their
houses&rsquo;; and thus gradually the University got the command
of the police, obtained privileges which enslaved the city, and
became masters where they had once been despised, starveling
scholars.&nbsp; The process was always the same.&nbsp; On the
feast of St. Scholastica, for example, in 1354, Walter de
Springheuse, Roger de Chesterfield, and other clerks, swaggered
into the Swyndlestock tavern in Carfax, began to speak ill of
John de Croydon&rsquo;s wine, and ended by pitching the tankard
at the head of that vintner.&nbsp; In ten minutes the town bell
at St. Martin&rsquo;s was rung, and the most terrible of all
Town-and-Gown rows began.&nbsp; The Chancellor could do no less
than bid St. Mary&rsquo;s bell reply to St. Martin&rsquo;s, and
shooting commenced.&nbsp; The Gown held their own very well at
first, and &lsquo;defended themselves till Vespertide,&rsquo;
when the citizens called in their neighbours, the rustics of
Cowley, Headington, and Hincksey.&nbsp; The results have been
precisely described in anticipation by Homer:</p>
<blockquote><p>&tau;&#8057;&phi;&rho;&alpha; &delta;&rsquo;

</blockquote>
<p>Which is as much as to say, &lsquo;The townsfolk call for help
to their neighbours, the yokels, that were more numerous than
they, and better men in battle . . . so when the sun turned to
the time of the loosing of oxen the Town drave in the ranks of
the Gown, and won the victory.&rsquo;&nbsp; They were strong, the
townsmen, but not merciful.&nbsp; &lsquo;The crowns of some
chaplains, viz. all the skin so far as the tonsure went, these
diabolical imps flayed off in scorn of their clergy,&rsquo; and
&lsquo;some poor innocents these confounded sons of Satan knocked
down, beat, and most cruelly wounded.&rsquo;&nbsp; The result, in
the long run, was that the University received from Edward <span
class="GutSmall">III.</span> &lsquo;a most large charter,
containing many liberties, some that they had before, and
<i>others that he had taken away from the town</i>.&rsquo;&nbsp;
Thus Edward granted to the University &lsquo;the custody of the
assize of bread, wine, and ale,&rsquo; the supervising of
measures and weights, the sole power of clearing the streets of
the town and suburbs.&nbsp; Moreover, the Mayor and the chief
Burghers were condemned yearly to a sort of public penance and
humiliation on St. Scholastica&rsquo;s Day.&nbsp; Thus, by the
middle of the fourteenth century, the strife of Town and Gown had
ended in the complete victory of the latter.</p>
<p>Though the University owed its success to its clerkly
character, and though the Legate backed it with all the power of
Rome, yet the scholars were Englishmen and Liberals first,
Catholics next.&nbsp; Thus they had all English sympathy with
them when they quarrelled with the Legate in 1238, and shot his
cook (who, indeed, had thrown hot broth at them); and thus, in
later days, the undergraduates were with Simon de Montfort
against King Henry, and aided the barons with a useful body of
archers.&nbsp; The University, too, constantly withstood the
Friars, who had settled in Oxford on pretence of wishing to
convert the Jews, and had attempted to get education into their
hands.&nbsp; &lsquo;The Preaching Friars, who had lately obtained
from the Pope divers privileges, particularly an exemption, as
they pretended, from being subject to the jurisdiction of the
University, began to behave themselves very insolent against the
Chancellors and Masters.&rsquo;&nbsp; (Wood, <i>Annals</i>, i.
399.)&nbsp; The conduct of the Friars caused endless appeals to
Rome, and in this matter, too, Oxford was stoutly national, and
resisted the Pope, as it had, on occasions, defied the
King.&nbsp; The King&rsquo;s Jews, too, the University kept in
pretty good order, and when, in 1268, a certain Hebrew snatched
the crucifix from the hand of the Chancellor and trod it under
foot, his tribesmen were compelled to raise &lsquo;a fair and
stately cross of marble, very curiously wrought,&rsquo; on the
scene of the sacrilege.</p>
<p>The growth in power and importance of academic corporations
having now been sketched, let us try to see what the outer aspect
of the town was like in these rude times, and what manner of life
the undergraduates led.&nbsp; For this purpose we may be allowed
to draw a rude, but not unfaithful, picture of a day in a
student&rsquo;s life.&nbsp; No incident will be introduced for
which there is not authority, in Wood, or in Mr. Anstey&rsquo;s
invaluable documents, the <i>Munimenta Academica</i>, published
in the collection of the Master of the Rolls.&nbsp; Some latitude
as to dates must be allowed, it is true, and we are not of course
to suppose that any one day of life was ever so gloriously
crowded as that of our undergraduate.</p>
<p>The time is the end of the fourteenth century.&nbsp; The
forest and the moor stretch to the east gate of the city.&nbsp;
Magdalen bridge is not yet built, nor of course the tower of
Magdalen, which M. Brunet-Debaines has sketched from Christ
Church walks.&nbsp; Not till about 1473 was the tower built, and
years would pass after that before choristers saluted with their
fresh voices from its battlements the dawn of the first of May,
or sermons were preached from the beautiful stone pulpit in the
open air.&nbsp; When our undergraduate, Walter de Stoke, or, more
briefly, Stoke, was at Oxford, the spires of the city were
few.&nbsp; Where Magdalen stands now, the old Hospital of St.
John then stood&mdash;a foundation of Henry <span
class="GutSmall">III.</span>&mdash;but the Jews were no longer
allowed to bury their dead in the close, which is now the
&lsquo;Physic Garden.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;In 1289,&rsquo; as Wood
says, &lsquo;the Jews were banished from England for various
enormities and crimes committed by them.&rsquo;&nbsp; The Great
and Little Jewries&mdash;those dim, populous streets behind the
modern Post Office&mdash;had been sacked and gutted.&nbsp; No
clerk would ever again risk his soul for a fair Jewess&rsquo;s
sake, nor lose his life for his love at the hands of that eminent
theologian, Fulke de Breaut&eacute;.&nbsp; The beautiful tower of
Merton was still almost fresh, and the spires of St.
Mary&rsquo;s, of old All Saints, of St. Frideswyde, and the
strong tower of New College on the city wall, were the most
prominent features in a bird&rsquo;s-eye view of the town.&nbsp;
But though part of Merton, certainly the chapel tower as we have
seen, the odd muniment-room with the steep stone roof, and,
perhaps, the Library, existed; though New was built; and though
Balliol and University owned some halls, on, or near, the site of
the present colleges, Oxford was still an university of poor
scholars, who lived in town&rsquo;s-people&rsquo;s dwellings.</p>
<p>Thus, in the great quarrel with the Legate in 1238, John
Currey, of Scotland, boarded with Will Maynard, while Hugh le
Verner abode in the house of Osmund the Miller, with Raynold the
Irishman and seven of his fellows.&nbsp; John Mortimer and Rob
Norensis lodged with Augustine Gosse, and Adam de Wolton lodged
in Cat Street, where you can still see the curious arched doorway
of Catte&rsquo;s, or St. Catherine&rsquo;s Hall.&nbsp; By the
time of my hero, Walter Stoke, the King had not yet decreed that
all scholars of years of discretion should live in the house of
some sufficient principal (1421); so let him lodge at Catte Hall,
at the corner of the street that leads to New College out of the
modern Broad Street, which was then the City Ditch.&nbsp; It is
six o&rsquo;clock on a summer morning, and the bells waken Stoke,
who is sleeping on a flock bed, in his little
<i>camera</i>.&nbsp; His room, though he is not one of the
luxurious clerks whom the University scolds in various statutes,
is pretty well furnished.&nbsp; His bed alone is worth not less
than fifteenpence; he has a &lsquo;cofer&rsquo; valued at
twopence (we have plenty of those old valuations), and in his
cofer are his black coat, which no one would think dear at
fourpence, his tunic, cheap at tenpence, &lsquo;a roll of the
seven Psalms,&rsquo; and twelve books only &lsquo;at his beddes
heed.&rsquo;&nbsp; Stoke has not</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Twenty bookes, clothed in blak and reed,<br
/>
Of Aristotil and of his philosophie,&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>like Chaucer&rsquo;s Undergraduate, who must have been a
bibliophile.&nbsp; There are not many records of &lsquo;as many
as twenty bookes&rsquo; in the old valuations.&nbsp; The great
ornament of the room is a neat trophy of buckler, bow, arrows,
and two daggers, all hanging conveniently on the wall.&nbsp;
Stoke opens his eyes, yawns, looks round for his clothes, and
sees, with no surprise, that his laundress has not sent home his
clean linen.&nbsp; No; Christina, of the parish of St. Martin,
who used to be Stoke&rsquo;s <i>lotrix</i>, has been detected at
last.&nbsp; &lsquo;Under pretence of washing for scholars,
<i>multa mala perpetrata fuerunt</i>,&rsquo; she has committed
all manner of crimes, and is now in the Spinning House,
<i>carcerata fuit</i>.&nbsp; Stoke wastes a malediction on the
laundress, and, dressing as well as he may, runs down to
Parson&rsquo;s Pleasure, I hope, and has a swim, for I find no
tub in his room, or, indeed, in the <i>camera</i> of any other
scholar.&nbsp; It is now time to go, not to chapel&mdash;for
Catte&rsquo;s has no chapel&mdash;but to parish Church, and Stoke
goes very devoutly to St. Peter&rsquo;s, where we shall find him
again, later in the day, in another mood.&nbsp; About eight
o&rsquo;clock he &lsquo;commonises&rsquo; with a Paris man,
Henricus de Bourges, who has an admirable mode of cooking
omelettes, which makes his company much sought after at
breakfast-time.&nbsp; The University, in old times, was full of
French students, as Paris was thronged by Englishmen.&nbsp;
Lectures begin at nine, and first there is lecture in the hall by
the principal of Catte&rsquo;s.&nbsp; That scholar receives his
pupils in a bare room, where it is very doubtful whether the
students are allowed to sit down.&nbsp; From the curious old seal
of the University of St. Andrews, however, it appears that the
luxury of forms was permitted, in Scotland, to all but the
servitors, who held the lecturer&rsquo;s candles.&nbsp; The
principal of Catte&rsquo;s is in academic dress, and wears a
black cape, boots, and a hood.&nbsp; The undergraduates have no
distinguishing costume.&nbsp; After an hour or two of
<i>viv&acirc; voce</i> exercises in the grammar of Priscian,
preparatory lecture is over, and a reading man will hurry off to
the &lsquo;schools,&rsquo; a set of low-roofed buildings between
St. Mary&rsquo;s and Brasenose.&nbsp; There he will find the
Divinity &lsquo;school&rsquo; or lecture-room in the place of
honour, with Medicine on one hand and Law on the other; the
lecture-rooms for grammar, rhetoric, logic, arithmetic, music,
geometry, and astronomy, for metaphysics, ethics, and &lsquo;the
tongues,&rsquo; stretching down School Street on either
side.&nbsp; Here the Pr&aelig;lectors are holding forth, and all
newly made Masters of Arts are bound to teach their subject
<i>regere scholas</i>, whether they like it or not.&nbsp; Our
friend, Master Stoke, however, is on pleasure bent, and means to
pay his fine of twopence for omitting lecture, and go off to the
festival of his <i>nation</i> (he is of the Southern nation, and
hates Scotch, Welsh, and Irish) in the parish Church.&nbsp; He
stops in the Flower Market and at a barber&rsquo;s shop on his
way to St. Peter&rsquo;s, and comes forth a wonderful pagan
figure with a Bacchic mask covering his honest countenance, with
horns protruding through a wig of tow, with vine-leaves twisted
in and out of the horns, and roses stuck wherever there is room
for roses.&nbsp; Henricus de Bourges, and half a dozen Picardy
men, with some merry souls from the Southern side of the Thames,
are jigging down the High, playing bag-pipes and guitars.&nbsp;
To these Stoke joins himself, and they waltz joyously into the
church, and in and out of the gateways of the different halls,
singing,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Mihi est propositum in taberna mori,<br />
Vinum sit appositum morientis ori,<br />
Ut dicant, quum venerint, angelorum chori<br />
Deus sit propitius huic potatori.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The students of the Northern nations mock, of course, at these
revellers, thumbs are bitten, threats exchanged, and we shall see
what comes of the quarrel.&nbsp; But the hall bells chime
half-past noon; it is dinner-time in Oxford, and Stoke, as he
throws off his mask (<i>larva</i>) and vine-leaves, mutters to
himself the equivalent for &lsquo;there <i>will</i> be a row
about this.&rsquo;&nbsp; There will, indeed, for the penalty is
not &lsquo;crossing at the buttery,&rsquo; nor
&lsquo;gating,&rsquo; but&mdash;excommunication!&nbsp; (<i>Munim.
Academ.</i>, i. 18.)&nbsp; Dinner is not a very quiet affair, for
the Catte&rsquo;s men have had to fight for their beer in the
public streets with some Canterbury College fellows who were set
on by their Warden, of all people, to commit this violence (<i>ut
vi et violentia raperent cerevisiam aliorum scholarum in
vico</i>): however, Catte&rsquo;s has had the best of it, and
there is beer in plenty.&nbsp; It is possible, however, that fish
is scarce, for certain &lsquo;forestallers&rsquo;
(<i>regratarii</i>) have been buying up salmon and soles, and
refusing to sell them at less than double the proper price.&nbsp;
On the whole, however, there a rude abundance of meat and bread;
indeed, Stoke may have fared better in Catte&rsquo;s than the
modern undergraduate does in the hall of the college protected by
St. Catherine.&nbsp; After dinner there would be lecture in Lent,
but we are not in Lent.&nbsp; A young man&rsquo;s fancy lightly
turns to the Beaumont, north of the modern Beaumont Street, where
there are wide playing-fields, and space for archery, foot-ball,
stool-ball, and other sports.&nbsp; Stoke rushes out of hall, and
runs upstairs into the <i>camera</i> of Roger de Freshfield, a
reading man, but a good fellow.&nbsp; He knocks and enters, and
finds Freshfield over his favourite work, the <i>Posterior
Analytics</i>, and a pottle of strawberries.&nbsp; &lsquo;Come
down to the Beaumont, old man,&rsquo; he says, &lsquo;and play
pyked staffe.&rsquo;&nbsp; Roger is disinclined to move, he
<i>must</i> finish the <i>Posterior Analytics</i>.&nbsp; Stoke
lounges about, in the eternal fashion of undergraduates after
luncheon, and picking up the <i>Philobiblon</i> of Richard de
Bury (then quite a new book), clinches his argument in favour of
pyke and staffe with a quotation: &lsquo;You will perhaps see a
stiff-necked youth lounging sluggishly in his study . . . He is
not ashamed to eat fruit and cheese over an open book, and to
transfer his cup from side to side upon it.&rsquo;&nbsp; Thus
addressed, Roger lays aside his <i>Analytics</i>, and the pair
walk down by Balliol, to the Beaumont, where pyked staffe, or
sword and buckler, is played.&nbsp; At the Beaumont they find two
men who say that &lsquo;sword and buckler can be played sofft and
ffayre,&rsquo; that is, without hard hitting, and with one of
these Stoke begins to fence.&nbsp; Alas! a dispute arose about a
stroke, the by-standers interfered, and Stoke&rsquo;s opponent
drew his hanger (<i>extraxit cultellum vocatum hangere</i>), and
hit one John Felerd over the sconce.&nbsp; On this the Proctors
come up, and the assailant is put in Bocardo, while Stoke goes
off to a &lsquo;pass-supper&rsquo; given by an <i>inceptor</i>,
who has just taken his degree.&nbsp; These suppers were not
voluntary entertainments, but enforced by law.&nbsp; At supper
the talk ranges over University gossip, they tell of the scholar
who lately tried to raise the devil in Grope Lane, and was
pleased by the gentlemanly manner of the foul fiend.&nbsp; They
speak of the Queen&rsquo;s man, who has just been plucked for
maintaining that <i>Ego currit</i>, or <i>ego est currens</i>, is
as good Latin as <i>ego curro</i>.&nbsp; Then the party breaks
up, and Stoke goes towards Merton, with some undergraduates of
that college, Bridlington, Alderberk, and Lymby.&nbsp; At the
corner of Grope Lane, out come many men of the Northern nations,
armed with shields, and bows and arrows.&nbsp; Stoke and his
friends run into Merton for weapons, and &lsquo;standing in a
window of that hall, shot divers arrows, and one that Bridlington
shot hit Henry de l&rsquo;Isle, and David Kirkby unmercifully
perished, for after John de Benton had given him a dangerous
wound in the head with his faulchion, came Will de la Hyde and
wounded him in the knee with his sword.&rsquo;</p>
<p>These were rough times, and it is not improbable that Stoke
had a brush with the Town before he got safely back to
Catte&rsquo;s Hall.&nbsp; The old rudeness gave way gradually, as
the colleges swallowed up the irregular halls, and as the
scholars unattached, <i>infando nomine Chamber-Dekyns</i>, ceased
to exist.&nbsp; Learning, however, dwindled, as colleges
increased, under the clerical and reactionary rule of the House
of Lancaster.</p>

67</span>CHAPTER III<br />
<span class="GutSmall">THE RENAISSANCE AND THE
REFORMATION</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">We</span> have now arrived at a period in
the history of Oxford which is confused and unhappy, but for us
full of interest, and perhaps of instruction.&nbsp; The hundred
years that passed by between the age of Chaucer and the age of
Erasmus were, in Southern Europe, years of the most eager
life.&nbsp; We hear very often&mdash;too often, perhaps&mdash;of
what is called the Renaissance.&nbsp; The energy of delight with
which Italy welcomed the new birth of art, of literature, of
human freedom, has been made familiar to every reader.&nbsp; It
is not with Italy, but with England and with Oxford, that we are
concerned.&nbsp; How did the University and the colleges prosper
in that strenuous time when the world ran after loveliness of
form and colour, as, in other ages, it has run after warlike
renown, or the far-off rewards of the saintly life?&nbsp; What
was Oxford doing when Florence, Venice, and Rome were striving
towards no meaner goal than perfection?</p>
<p>It must be said that &lsquo;the spring came slowly up this
way.&rsquo;&nbsp; The University merely reflected the very
practical character of the people.&nbsp; In contemplating the
events of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, in their
influence on English civilisation, we are reminded once more of
the futility of certain modern aspirations.&nbsp; No amount of
University Commissions, nor of well-meant reforms, will change
the nature of Englishmen.&nbsp; It is impossible, by
distributions of University prizes and professorships, to attract
into the career of letters that proportion of industry and
ingenuity which, in Germany for example, is devoted to the
scholastic life.&nbsp; Politics, trade, law, sport, religion,
will claim their own in England, just as they did at the Revival
of Letters.&nbsp; The illustrious century which Italy employed in
unburying, appropriating, and enjoying the treasures of Greek
literature and art, our fathers gave, in England, to dynastic and
constitutional squabbles, and to religious broils.&nbsp; The
Renaissance in England, and chiefly in Oxford, was like a bitter
and changeful spring.&nbsp; There was an hour of genial warmth,
there breathed a wind from the south, in the lifetime of Chaucer;
then came frosts and storms; again the brief sunshine of court
favour shone on literature for a while, when Henry <span
class="GutSmall">VIII.</span> encouraged study, and Wolsey and
Fox founded Christ Church and Corpus Christi College; once more
the bad days of religious strife returned, and the promise of
learning was destroyed.&nbsp; Thus the chief result of the
awakening thought of the fourteenth century in England was not a
lively delight in literature, but the appearance of the
Lollards.&nbsp; The intensely practical genius of our race turned
not to letters, but to questions about the soul and its future,
about property and its distribution.&nbsp; The Lollards were put
down in Oxford; &lsquo;the tares were weeded out&rsquo; by the
House of Lancaster, and in the process the germs of free thought,
of originality, and of a rational education, were
destroyed.&nbsp; &lsquo;Wyclevism did domineer among us,&rsquo;
says Wood; and, in fact, the intellect of the University was
absorbed, like the intellect of France during the heat of the
Jansenist controversy, in defending or assailing &lsquo;267
damned conclusions,&rsquo; drawn from the books of Wyclif.&nbsp;
The University &lsquo;lost many of her children through the
profession of Wyclevism.&rsquo;&nbsp; Those who remained were
often &lsquo;beneficed clerks.&rsquo;&nbsp; The Friars lifted up
their heads again, and Oxford was becoming a large ecclesiastical
school.&nbsp; As the University declared to Archbishop Chichele
(1438), &lsquo;Our noble mother, that was blessed in so goodly an
offspring, is all but utterly destroyed and
desolate.&rsquo;&nbsp; Presently the foreign wars and the wars of
the Roses drained the University of the youth of England.&nbsp;
The country was overrun with hostile forces, or infested by
disbanded soldiers.&nbsp; Plague and war, war and plague, and
confusion, alternate in the annals.&nbsp; Sickly as Oxford is
to-day by climate and situation, she is a city of health compared
to what she was in the middle ages.&nbsp; In 1448 &lsquo;a
pestilence broke out, occasioned by the overflowing of waters, .
. . also by the lying of many scholars in one room or dormitory
in almost every Hall, which occasioned nasty air and smells, and
consequently diseases.&rsquo;&nbsp; In the general dulness and
squalor two things were remarkable: one, the last splendour of
the feudal time; the other, the first dawn of the new learning
from Italy.&nbsp; In 1452, George Neville of Balliol, brother of
the King-maker, gave the most prodigious pass-supper that was
ever served in Oxford.&nbsp; On the first day there were 600
messes of meat, divided into three courses.&nbsp; The second
course is worthy of the attention of the epicure:</p>

<p>Against this prodigious gormandising we must set that noble
gift, the Library presented to Oxford by Duke Humfrey of
Gloucester.&nbsp; In the Catalogue, drawn up in 1439, we mark
many books of the utmost value to the impoverished
students.&nbsp; Here are the works of Plato, and the
<i>Ethics</i> and <i>Politics</i> of Aristotle, translated by
Leonard the Aretine.&nbsp; Here, among the numerous writings of
the Fathers, are Tully and Seneca, Averroes and Avicenna,
<i>Bellum Trojae cum secretis secretorum</i>, Apuleius, Aulus
Gellius, Livy, Boccaccio, Petrarch.&nbsp; Here, with Ovid&rsquo;s
verses, is the Commentary on Dante, and his <i>Divine
Comedy</i>.&nbsp; Here, rarest of all, is a Greek Dictionary, the
silent father of Liddel&rsquo;s and Scott&rsquo;s to be.</p>

<p>The most hopeful fact in the University annals, after the gift
of those manuscripts (to which the very beauty of their
illuminations proved ruinous in Puritan times), was the
establishment of a printing-press at Oxford, and the arrival of
certain Italians, &lsquo;to propagate and settle the studies of
true and genuine humanity among us.&rsquo;&nbsp; The exact date
of the introduction of printing let us leave to be determined by
the learned writer who is now at work on the history of
Oxford.&nbsp; The advent of the Italians is dated by Wood in
1488.&nbsp; Polydore Virgil had lectured in New College.&nbsp;
&lsquo;He first of all taught literature in Oxford.&nbsp;
Cyprianus and Nicholaus, <i>Italici</i>, also arrived and dined
with the Vice-President of Magdalen on Christmas Day.&nbsp; Lily
and Colet, too, one of them the founder, the other the first Head
Master, of St. Paul&rsquo;s School, were about this time studying
in Italy, under the great Politian and Hermolaus Barbarus.&nbsp;
Oxford, which had so long been in hostile communication with
Italy as represented by the Papal Courts, at last touched, and
was thrilled by the electric current of Italian
civilisation.&nbsp; At this conjuncture of affairs, who but is
reminded of the youth and the education of Gargantua?&nbsp; Till
the very end of the fifteenth century Oxford had been that
&lsquo;huge barbarian pupil,&rsquo; and had revelled in vast
Rabelaisian suppers: &lsquo;of fat beeves he had killed three
hundred sixty seven thousand and fourteen, that in the entering
in of spring he might have plenty of powdered beef.&rsquo;&nbsp;
The bill of fare of George Neville&rsquo;s feast is like one of
the catalogues dear to the Cur&eacute; of Meudon.&nbsp; For
Oxford, as for Gargantua, &lsquo;they appointed a great
sophister-doctor, that read him Donatus, Theodoletus, and Alanus,
in <i>parabolis</i>.&rsquo;&nbsp; Oxford spent far more than
Gargantua&rsquo;s eighteen years and eleven months over
&lsquo;the book de Modis significandis, with the commentaries of
Berlinguandus and a rabble of others.&rsquo;&nbsp; Now, under
Colet, and Erasmus (1497), Oxford was put, like Gargantua, under
new masters, and learned that the old scholarship &lsquo;had been
but brutishness, and the old wisdom but blunt, foppish toys
serving only to bastardise noble spirits, and to corrupt all the
flower of youth.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The prospects of classical learning at Oxford (and, whatever
may be the case to-day, on classical learning depended, in the
fifteenth century, the fortunes of European literature) now
seemed fair enough.&nbsp; People from the very source of
knowledge were lecturing in Oxford.&nbsp; Wolsey was Bursar of
Magdalen.&nbsp; The colleges, to which B. N. C. was added in
1509, and C. C. C. in 1516, were competing with each other for
success in the New Learning.&nbsp; Fox, the founder of C. C. C.,
established in his college two chairs of Greek and Latin,
&lsquo;to extirpate barbarism.&rsquo;&nbsp; Meanwhile, Cambridge
had to hire an Italian to write public speeches at twenty pence
each!&nbsp; Henry <span class="GutSmall">VIII.</span> in his
youth was, like Francis I., the patron of literature, as
literature was understood in Italy.&nbsp; He saw in learning a
new splendour to adorn his court, a new source of intellectual
luxury, though even Henry had an eye on the theological aspect of
letters.&nbsp; Between 1500 and 1530 Oxford was noisy with the
clink of masons&rsquo; hammers and chisels.&nbsp; Brasenose,
Corpus, and the magnificent kitchen of Christ Church, were being
erected.&nbsp; (The beautiful staircase, which M. Brunet-Debaines
has sketched, was not finished till 1640.&nbsp; The world owes it
to Dr. Fell.&nbsp; The Oriel niches, designed in the
illustration, are of rather later date.)&nbsp; The streets were
crowded with carts, dragging in from all the neighbouring
quarries stones for the future homes of the fair
humanities.&nbsp; Erasmus found in Oxford a kind of substitute
for the Platonic Society of Florence.&nbsp; &lsquo;He would
hardly care much about going to Italy at all, except for the sake
of having been there.&nbsp; When I listen to Colet, it seems to
me like listening to Plato himself&rsquo;; and he praises the
judgment and learning of those Englishmen, Grocyn and Linacre,
who had been taught in Italy.</p>
<p>In spite of all this promise, the Renaissance in England was
rotten at the root.&nbsp; Theology killed it, or, at the least,
breathed on it a deadly blight.&nbsp; Our academic forefathers
&lsquo;drove at practice,&rsquo; and saw everything with the eyes
of party men, and of men who recognised no interest save that of
religion.&nbsp; It is Mr. Seebohm (<i>Oxford Reformers</i>,
1867), I think, who detects, in Colet&rsquo;s concern with the
religious side of literature, the influence of Savonarola.&nbsp;
When in Italy &lsquo;he gave himself entirely to the study of the
Holy Scriptures.&rsquo;&nbsp; He brought to England from Italy,
not the early spirit of Pico of Mirandola, the delightful freedom
of his youth, but his later austerity, his later concern with the
harmony of scripture and philosophy.&nbsp; The book which the
dying Petrarch held wistfully in his hands, revering its very
material shape, though he could not spell its contents, was the
<i>Iliad</i> of Homer.&nbsp; The book which the young Renaissance
held in its hands in England, with reverence and eagerness as
strong and tender, contained the Epistles of St. Paul.&nbsp; It
was on the Epistles that Colet lectured in 1496&ndash;97, when
doctors and abbots flocked to hear him, with their note-books in
their hands.&nbsp; Thus Oxford differed from Florence, England
from Italy: the former all intent on what it believed to be the
very Truth, the latter all absorbed on what it knew to be no
other than Beauty herself.</p>
<p>We cannot afford to regret the choice that England and Oxford
made.&nbsp; The search for Truth was as certain to bring
&lsquo;not peace but a sword&rsquo; as the search for Beauty was
to bring the decadence of Italy, the corruption of manners, the
slavery of two hundred years.&nbsp; Still, our practical
earnestness did rob Oxford of the better side of the
Renaissance.&nbsp; It is not possible here to tell the story of
religious and social changes, which followed so hard upon each
other, in the reigns of Henry <span
class="GutSmall">VIII.</span>, Edward <span
class="GutSmall">VI.</span>, Mary, and Elizabeth.&nbsp; A few
moments in these stormy years are still memorable for some
terrible or ludicrous event.</p>
<p>That Oxford was rather &lsquo;Trojan&rsquo; than
&lsquo;Greek,&rsquo; that men were more concerned about their
dinners and their souls than their prosody and philosophy, in
1531, is proved by the success of Grynaeus.&nbsp; He visited the
University and carried off quantities of MSS., chiefly
Neoplatonic, on which no man set any value.&nbsp; Yet, in 1535,
Layton, a Commissioner, wrote to Cromwell that he and his
companions had established the New Learning in the
University.&nbsp; A Lecture in Greek was founded in Magdalen, two
chairs of Greek and Latin in New, two in All Souls, and two
already existed, as we have seen, in C. C. C.&nbsp; This Layton
is he that took a Rabelaisian and unquotable revenge on that old
tyrant of the Schools, Duns Scotus.&nbsp; &lsquo;We have set
Dunce in Bocardo, and utterly banished him from Oxford for ever,
with all his blind glosses . . . And the second time we came to
New College we found all the great quadrant full of the leaves of
Dunce, the wind blowing them into every corner.&nbsp; And there
we found a certain Mr. Greenfield, a gentleman of
Buckinghamshire, gathering up part of the same books&rsquo;
leaves, as he said, therewith to make him <i>sewers</i> or
<i>blanshers</i>, to keep the deer within his wood, thereby to
have the better cry with his hounds.&rsquo;&nbsp; Ah! if the
University Commissioners would only set Aristotle, and Messrs.
Ritter and Preller, &lsquo;in Bocardo,&rsquo; many a young
gentleman out of Buckinghamshire and other counties would
joyously help in the good work, and use the pages, if not for
<i>blanshers</i>, for other sportive purposes!</p>
<p>&lsquo;<i>Habent sua fata libelli</i>,&rsquo; as Terentianus
Maurus says, in a frequently quoted verse.&nbsp; If
Cromwell&rsquo;s Commissioners were hard on Duns, the Visitors of
Edward <span class="GutSmall">VI.</span> were ruthless in their
condemnation of everything that smacked of Popery or of
magic.&nbsp; Evangelical religion in England has never been very
favourable to learning.&nbsp; Thus, in 1550 &lsquo;the ancient
libraries were by their appointment rifled.&nbsp; Many
manuscripts, guilty of no other superstition than red letters in
the front or titles, were condemned to the fire . . . Such books
wherein appeared angles were thought sufficient to be destroyed,
because accounted Papish or diabolical, or both.&rsquo;&nbsp; A
cart-load of MSS., lucubrations of the Fellows of Merton, chiefly
in controversial divinity, was taken away; but, by the good
services of one Herks, a Dutchman, many books were preserved,
and, later, entered the Bodleian Library.&nbsp; The world can
spare the controversial manuscripts of the Fellows of Merton, but
who knows what invaluable scrolls may have perished in the
Puritan bonfire!&nbsp; Persons, the librarian of Balliol, sold
old books to buy Protestant ones.&nbsp; Two noble libraries were
sold for forty shillings, for waste paper.&nbsp; Thus the reign
of Edward <span class="GutSmall">VI.</span> gave free play to
that ascetic and intolerable hatred of letters which had now and
again made its voice heard under Henry <span
class="GutSmall">VIII.</span>&nbsp; Oxford was almost
empty.&nbsp; The schools were used by laundresses, as a place
wherein clothes might conveniently be dried.&nbsp; The citizens
encroached on academic property.&nbsp; Some schools were quite
destroyed, and the sites converted into gardens.&nbsp; Few men
took degrees.&nbsp; The college plate and the jewels left by
pious benefactors were stolen, and went to the melting-pot.&nbsp;
Thus flourished Oxford under Edward <span
class="GutSmall">VI.</span></p>
<p>The reign of Mary was scarcely more favourable to
letters.&nbsp; No one knew what to be at in religion.&nbsp; In
Magdalen no one could be found to say Mass, the fellows were
turned out, the undergraduates were whipped&mdash;boyish
martyrs&mdash;and crossed at the buttery.&nbsp; What most
pleases, in this tragic reign, is the anecdote of Edward Anne of
Corpus.&nbsp; Anne, with the conceit of youth, had written a
Latin satire on the Mass.&nbsp; He was therefore sentenced to be
publicly flogged in the hall of his college, and to receive one
lash for each line in his satire.&nbsp; Never, surely, was a poet
so sharply taught the merit of brevity.&nbsp; How Edward Anne
must have regretted that he had not knocked off an epigram, a
biting couplet, or a smart quatrain with the sting of the wit in
the tail!</p>
<p>Oxford still retains a memory of the hideous crime of this
reign.&nbsp; In Broad Street, under the windows of Balliol, there
is a small stone cross in the pavement.&nbsp; This marks the
place where, some years ago, a great heap of wooden ashes was
found.&nbsp; These ashes were the remains of the fire of October
16th, 1555&mdash;the day when Ridley and Latimer were
burned.&nbsp; &lsquo;They were brought,&rsquo; says Wood,
&lsquo;to a place over against Balliol College, where now stands
a row of poor cottages, a little before which, under the town
wall, ran so clear a stream that it gave the name of Canditch,
<i>candida fossa</i>, to the way leading by it.&rsquo;&nbsp; To
recover the memory of that event, let the reader fancy himself on
the top of the tower of St. Michael&rsquo;s, that is, immediately
above the city wall.&nbsp; No houses interfere between him and
the open country, in which Balliol stands; not with its present
frontage, but much farther back.&nbsp; A clear stream runs
through the place where is now Broad Street, and the road above
is dark with a swaying crowd, out of which rises the vapour of
smoke from the martyrs&rsquo; pile.&nbsp; At your feet, on the
top of Bocardo prison (which spanned the street at the North
Gate), Cranmer stands manacled, watching the fiery death which is
soon to purge away the memory of his own faults and crimes.&nbsp;
He, too, joined that &lsquo;noble army of martyrs&rsquo; who
fought all, though they knew it not, for one cause&mdash;the
freedom of the human spirit.</p>
<p>It was in a night-battle that they fell, and &lsquo;confused
was the cry of the p&aelig;an,&rsquo; but they won the victory,
and we have entered into the land for which they contended.&nbsp;
When we think of these martyrdoms, can we wonder that the Fellows
of Lincoln did not spare to ring a merry peal on their gaudy-day,
the day of St. Hugh, even though Mary the Queen had just left her
bitter and weary life?</p>
<p>It would be pleasant to have to say that learning returned to
Oxford on the rising of &lsquo;that bright Occidental star, Queen
Elizabeth.&rsquo;&nbsp; On the other hand, the University
recovered slowly, after being &lsquo;much troubled,&rsquo; as
Wood says, &lsquo;<i>and hurried up and down</i> by the changes
of religion.&rsquo;&nbsp; We get a glimpse, from Wood, of the
Fellows of Merton singing the psalms of Sternhold and Hopkins
round a fire in the College Hall.&nbsp; We see the sub-warden
snatching the book out of the hands of a junior fellow, and
declaring &lsquo;that he would never dance after that
pipe.&rsquo;&nbsp; We find Oxford so illiterate, that she could
not even provide an University preacher!&nbsp; A country
gentleman, Richard Taverner of Woodeaton, would stroll into St.
Mary&rsquo;s, with his sword and damask gown, and give the
Academicians, destitute of academical advice, a sermon beginning
with these words:</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Arriving at the mount of St. Mary&rsquo;s,
I have brought you some fine bisketts baked in the Oven of
Charitie, carefully conserved for the chickens of the Church, the
sparrows of the spirit, and the sweet swallows of
salvation.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In spite of these evil symptoms, a Greek oration and plenty of
Latin plays were ready for Queen Elizabeth when she visited
Oxford in 1566.&nbsp; The religious refugees, who had
&lsquo;eaten mice at Zurich&rsquo; in Mary&rsquo;s time, had
returned, and their influence was hostile to learning.&nbsp; A
man who had lived on mice for his faith was above Greek.&nbsp;
The court which contained Sydney, and which welcomed Bruno, was
strong enough to make the classics popular.&nbsp; That famed
Polish Count, Alasco, was &lsquo;received with Latin orations and
disputes (1583) in the best manner,&rsquo; and only a scoffing
Italian, like Bruno, ventured to call the Heads of Houses <i>the
Drowsy heads</i>&mdash;<i>dormitantes</i>.&nbsp; Bruno was a man
whom nothing could teach to speak well of people in
authority.&nbsp; Oxford enjoyed the religious peace (not extended
to &lsquo;Seminarists&rsquo;) of Elizabeth&rsquo;s and
James&rsquo;s reigns, and did not foresee that she was about to
become the home of the Court and a place of arms.</p>

89</span>CHAPTER IV<br />
<span class="GutSmall">JACOBEAN OXFORD</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> gardens of Wadham College on a
bright morning in early spring are a scene in which the memory of
old Oxford pleasantly lingers, and is easily revived.&nbsp; The
great cedars throw their secular shadow on the ancient turf, the
chapel forms a beautiful background; the whole place is exactly
what it was two hundred and sixty years ago.&nbsp; The stones of
Oxford walls, when they do not turn black and drop off in flakes,
assume tender tints of the palest gold, red, and orange.&nbsp;
Along a wall, which looks so old that it may well have formed a
defence of the ancient Augustinian priory, the stars of the
yellow jasmine flower abundantly.&nbsp; The industrious hosts of
the bees have left their cells, to labour in this first morning
of spring; the doves coo, the thrushes are noisy in the
trees.&nbsp; All breathes of the year renewal, and of the coming
April; and all that gladdens us may have gladdened some indolent
scholar in the time of King James.</p>
<p>In the reign of the first Stuart king of England, Oxford
became the town that we know.&nbsp; Even in Elizabeth&rsquo;s
days, could we ascend the stream of centuries, we should find
ourselves much at home in Oxford.&nbsp; The earliest trustworthy
map, that of Agas (1578), is worth studying, if we wish to
understand the Oxford that Elizabeth left, and that the
architects of James embellished, giving us the most interesting
examples of collegiate buildings, which are both stately and
comfortable.&nbsp; Let us enter Oxford by the Iffley Road, in the
year 1578.&nbsp; We behold, as Agas enthusiastically writes:</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;A citie seated, rich in everything,<br />
Girt with wood and water, meadow, corn, and hill.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The way is not bordered, of course, by the long, straggling
streets of rickety cottages, which now stretch from the bridge
half-way to Cowley and Iffley.&nbsp; The church, called by
ribalds &lsquo;the boiled rabbit,&rsquo; from its peculiar shape,
lies on the right; there is a gate in the city wall, on the place
where the road now turns to Holywell.&nbsp; At this time the
walls still existed, and ran from Magdalen past &lsquo;St.
Mary&rsquo;s College, called Newe,&rsquo; through Exeter, through
the site of Mr. Parker&rsquo;s shop, and all along the south side
of Broad Street to St. Michael&rsquo;s, and Bocardo Gate.&nbsp;
There the wall cut across to the castle.&nbsp; On the southern
side of the city, it skirted Corpus and Merton Gardens, and was
interrupted by Christ Church.&nbsp; Probably if it were possible
for us to visit Elizabethan Oxford, the walls and the five castle
towers would seem the most curious features in the place.&nbsp;
Entering the East Gate, Magdalen and Magdalen Grammar School
would be familiar objects.&nbsp; St. Edmund&rsquo;s Hall would be
in its present place, and Queen&rsquo;s would present its ancient
Gothic front.&nbsp; It is easy to imagine the change in the High
Street which would be produced by a Queen&rsquo;s not unlike
Oriel, in the room of the highly classical edifice of Wren.&nbsp;
All Souls would be less remarkable; at St. Mary&rsquo;s we should
note the absence of the &lsquo;scandalous image&rsquo; of Our
Lady over the door.&nbsp; At Merton the fellows&rsquo; quadrangle
did not yet exist, and a great wood-yard bordered on
Corpus.&nbsp; In front of Oriel was an open space with trees, and
there were a few scattered buildings, such as Peckwater&rsquo;s
Inn (on the site of &lsquo;Peck&rsquo;), and Canterbury
College.&nbsp; Tom Quad was stately but incomplete.&nbsp; Turning
from St. Mary&rsquo;s past B. N. C., we miss the attics in
Brasenose front, we miss the imposing Radcliffe, we miss all the
quadrangle of the Schools, except the Divinity school, and we
miss the Theatre.&nbsp; If we go down South Street, past Ch. Ch.
we find an open space where Pembroke stands.&nbsp; Where Wadham
is now, the most uniform, complete, and unchanged of all the
colleges, there are only the open pleasances, and perhaps a few
ruins of the Augustinian priory.&nbsp; St. John&rsquo;s lacks its
inner quadrangle, and Balliol, in place of its new buildings, has
its old delightful grove.&nbsp; As to the houses of the town,
they are not unlike the tottering and picturesque old roofs and
gables of King Street.</p>
<p>To the Oxford of Elizabeth&rsquo;s reign, then, the founders
and architects of her successor added, chiefly, the
Schools&rsquo; quadrangle, with the great gate of the five
orders, a building beautiful, as it were, in its own
despite.&nbsp; They added a smaller curiosity of the same sort,
at Merton; they added Wadham, perhaps their most successful
achievement.&nbsp; Their taste was a medley of new and old: they
made a not uninteresting effort to combine the exquisiteness of
Gothic decoration with the proportions of Greek
architecture.&nbsp; The tower of the five orders reminds the
spectator, in a manner, of the style of Milton.&nbsp; It is rich
and overloaded, yet its natural beauty is not abated by the
relics out of the great treasures of Greece and Rome, which are
built into the mass.&nbsp; The Ionic and Corinthian pillars are
like the Latinisms of Milton, the double-gilding which once
covered the figures and emblems of the upper part of the tower
gave them the splendour of Miltonic ornament.&nbsp; &lsquo;When
King James came from Woodstock to see this quadrangular pile, he
commanded the gilt figures to be whitened over,&rsquo; because
they were so dazzling, or, as Wood expresses it, &lsquo;so
glorious and splendid that none, especially when the sun shone,
could behold them.&rsquo;&nbsp; How characteristic of James is
this anecdote!&nbsp; He was by no means <i>le roi soleil</i>, as
courtiers called Louis <span class="GutSmall">XIV.</span>, as
divines called the pedantic Stuart.&nbsp; It is easy to fancy the
King issuing from the Library of Bodley, where he has been
turning over books of theology, prosing, and displaying his
learning for hours.&nbsp; The rheumy, blinking eyes are dazzled
in the sunlight, and he peevishly commands the gold work to be
&lsquo;whitened over.&rsquo;&nbsp; Certainly the translators of
the Bible were but ill-advised when they compared his Majesty to
the rising sun in all his glory.</p>
<p>James was rather fond of visiting Oxford and the royal
residence at Woodstock.&nbsp; We shall see that his Court, the
most dissolute, perhaps, that England ever tolerated, corrupted
the manners of the students.&nbsp; On one of his Majesty&rsquo;s
earliest visits he had a chance of displaying the penetration of
which he was so proud.&nbsp; James was always finding out
something or somebody, till it almost seemed as if people had
discovered that the best way to flatter him was to try to deceive
him.&nbsp; In 1604, there was in Oxford a certain Richard
Haydock, a Bachelor of Physic.&nbsp; This Haydock practised his
profession during the day like other mortals, but varied from the
kindly race of men by a pestilent habit of preaching all
night.&nbsp; It was Haydock&rsquo;s contention that he preached
unconsciously in his sleep, when he would give out a text with
the greatest gravity, and declare such sacred matters as were
revealed to him in slumber, &lsquo;his preaching coming by
revelation.&rsquo;&nbsp; Though people went to hear Haydock, they
were chiefly influenced by curiosity.&nbsp; &lsquo;His auditory
were willing to silence him by pulling, haling, and pinching him,
yet would he pertinaciously persist to the end, and sleep
still.&rsquo;&nbsp; The King was introduced into Haydock&rsquo;s
bedroom, heard him declaim, and next day cross-examined him in
private.&nbsp; Awed by the royal acuteness, Haydock confessed
that he was a humbug, and that he had taken to preaching all
night by way of getting a little notoriety, and because he felt
himself to be &lsquo;a buried man in the University.&rsquo;</p>

</a></p>
<p>That a man should hope to get reputation by preaching all
night is itself a proof that the University, under James, was too
theologically minded.&nbsp; When has it been otherwise?&nbsp; The
religious strife of the reigns of Henry <span
class="GutSmall">VIII.</span>, Edward <span
class="GutSmall">VI.</span>, and Mary, was not asleep; the
troubles of Charles&rsquo;s time were beginning to stir.&nbsp;
Oxford was as usual an epitome of English opinion.&nbsp; We see
the struggle of the wildest Puritanism, of Arminianism, of
Pelagianism, of a dozen &lsquo;isms,&rsquo; which are dead
enough, but have left their pestilent progeny to disturb a place
of religion, learning, and amusement.&nbsp; By whatever names the
different sects were called, men&rsquo;s ideas and tendencies
were divided into two easily recognisable classes.&nbsp;
Calvinism and Puritanism on one side, with the Puritanic haters
of letters and art, were opposed to Catholicism in germ, to
literature, and mundane studies.&nbsp; How difficult it is to
take a side in this battle, where both parties had one foot on
firm ground, the other in chaos, where freedom, or what was to
become freedom of thought, was allied with narrow bigotry, where
learning was chained to superstition!</p>
<p>As early as 1606, Mr. William Laud, B.D., of St. John&rsquo;s
College, began to disturb the University.&nbsp; The young man
preached a sermon which was thought to look Romewards.&nbsp; Laud
became <i>suspect</i>, it was thought a &lsquo;scandalous&rsquo;
thing to give him the usual courteous greetings in the street or
in the college quadrangle.&nbsp; From this time the history of
Oxford, for forty years, is mixed up with the history of
Laud.&nbsp; The divisions of Roundhead and of Cavalier have
begun.&nbsp; The majority of the undergraduates are on the side
of Laud; and the Court, the citizens, and many of the elder
members of the University, are with the Puritans.</p>
<p>The Court and the King, we have said, were fond of being
entertained in the college halls.&nbsp; James went from libraries
to academic disputations, thence to dinner, and from dinner to
look on at comedies played by the students.&nbsp; The Cambridge
men did not care to see so much royal favour bestowed on
Oxford.&nbsp; When James visited the University in 1641, a
Cambridge wit produced a remarkable epigram.&nbsp; For some
mysterious reason the playful fancies of the sister University
have never been greatly admired at Oxford, where the brisk air,
men flatter themselves, breeds nimbler humours.&nbsp; Here is
part of the Cantab&rsquo;s epigram:</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;To Oxenford the King has gone,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With all his mighty peers,<br />
That hath in peace maintained us,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; These five or six long years.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The poem maunders on for half a dozen lines, and &lsquo;loses
itself in the sands,&rsquo; like the River Rhine, without coming
to any particular point or conclusion.&nbsp; How much more lively
is the Oxford couplet on the King, who, being bored by some
amateur theatricals, twice or thrice made as if he would leave
the hall, where men failed dismally to entertain him.</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;&ldquo;The King himself did
offer,&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;What, I pray?&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;He offered twice or thrice&mdash;to go
away!&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As a result of the example of the Court, the students began to
wear love-locks.&nbsp; In Elizabeth&rsquo;s time, when men wore
their hair &lsquo;no longer than their ears,&rsquo; long locks
had been a mark, says Wood, of &lsquo;swaggerers.&rsquo;&nbsp;
Drinking and gambling were now very fashionable, undergraduates
were whipped for wearing boots, while &lsquo;Puritans were many
and troublesome,&rsquo; and Laud publicly declared (1614) that
&lsquo;Presbyterians were as bad as Papists.&rsquo;&nbsp; Did
Laud, after all, think Papists so very bad?&nbsp; In 1617 he was
President of his college, St. John&rsquo;s, on which he set his
mark.&nbsp; It is to Laud and to Inigo Jones that Oxford owes the
beautiful garden-front, perhaps the most lovely thing in
Oxford.&nbsp; From the gardens&mdash;where for so many summers
the beauty of England has rested in the shadow of the
chestnut-trees, amid the music of the chimes, and in air heavy
with the scent of the acacia flowers&mdash;from the gardens,
Laud&rsquo;s building looks rather like a country-house than a
college.</p>
<p>If St. John&rsquo;s men have lived in the University too much
as if it were a large country-house, if they have imitated rather
the Toryism than the learning of their great Archbishop, the
blame is partly Laud&rsquo;s.&nbsp; How much harm to study he and
Waynflete have unwittingly done, and how much they have added to
the romance of Oxford!&nbsp; It is easy to understand that men
find it a weary task to read in sight of the beauty of the groves
of Magdalen and of St. John&rsquo;s.&nbsp; When Kubla Khan
&lsquo;a stately pleasure-dome decreed,&rsquo; he did not mean to
settle students there, and to ask them for metaphysical essays,
and for Greek and Latin prose compositions.&nbsp; Kubla Khan
would have found a palace to his desire in the gardens of Laud,
or where Cherwell, &lsquo;meandering with a mazy motion,&rsquo;
stirs the green weeds, and flashes from the mill-wheel, and flows
to the Isis through meadows white and purple with
fritillaries.</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;And here are gardens bright with sinuous
rills,<br />
Where blossoms many an incense-bearing tree&rsquo;;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>but here is scarcely the proper training-ground of first-class
men!</p>
<p>Oxford returned to her ancient uses in 1625.&nbsp; Soon after
the accession of Charles I. the plague broke out in London, and
Oxford entertained the Parliament, as six hundred years before
she had received the Witan.&nbsp; There seemed something ominous
in all that Charles did in his earlier years&mdash;the air, or
men&rsquo;s minds, was full of the presage of fate.&nbsp; It was
observed that the House of Commons met in the Divinity School,
and that the place seemed to have infected them with theological
passion.&nbsp; After 1625 there was never a Parliament but had
its committee to discuss religion, and to stray into the devious
places of divinity.&nbsp; The plague pursued Charles to
Oxford.&nbsp; In those days, and long afterwards, it was a common
complaint that the citizens built rows of poor cottages within
the walls, and that these cottages were crowded by dirty and
indigent people.&nbsp; Plague was bred almost yearly at Oxford,
and Charles really seems to have improved the sanitary
arrangements of the city.</p>
<p>Laud, the President of St. John&rsquo;s, became, by some
intrigue, Chancellor of the University.&nbsp; He made Oxford many
presents of Greek, Chinese, Hebrew, Latin, and Arabic MSS.&nbsp;
There may have been&mdash;let us hope there were&mdash;quiet
bookworms who enjoyed these gifts, while the town and University
were bubbling over with religious feuds.&nbsp; People grumbled
that &lsquo;Popish darts were whet afresh on a Dutch
grindstone.&rsquo;&nbsp; A series of anti-Romish and anti-Royal
sermons and pamphlets, followed as a rule by a series of
recantations, kept men&rsquo;s minds in a ferment.&nbsp; The good
that Laud did by his gifts&mdash;and he was a munificent patron
of learning&mdash;he destroyed by his dogmatism.&nbsp; Scholars
could not decipher Greek texts while they were torturing biblical
ones into arguments for and against the opinions of the
Chancellor.&nbsp; What is the true story about the gorgeous
vestments which were found in a box in the house of the President
of St. John&rsquo;s, and which are now preserved in the library
of that college?&nbsp; Did they belong to the last of the old
Catholic presidents of what was Chichele&rsquo;s College of St.
Bernard before the Reformation?&nbsp; Were they, on the other
hand, the property of Laud himself?&nbsp; It has been said that
Laud would not have known how to wear them.&nbsp; Fancy sees him
treasuring that bright ecclesiastical raiment,
&pi;&#8051;&pi;&lambda;&omicron;&iota;
&pi;&alpha;&mu;&pi;&omicron;&#8055;&kappa;&iota;&lambda;&omicron;&iota;,
in some place of security.&nbsp; At night, perhaps, when candles
were lit and curtains drawn, and he was alone, he may have
arrayed himself in the gorgeous chasuble before the mirror, as
Hetty wore her surreptitious finery.&nbsp; &lsquo;There is a
great deal of human nature in man.&rsquo;&nbsp; If Laud really
strutted in solitude, draped rather at random in these vestments,
the ecclesiastical gear is even more interesting than the thin
ivory-headed staff which supported him on his way to the
scaffold; more curious than the diary in which he recorded the
events of night and day, of dreaming hours and waking.&nbsp; In
the library at St. John&rsquo;s they show his bust&mdash;a
tarnished, gilded work of art.&nbsp; He has a neat little
cocked-up moustache, not like a prelate&rsquo;s; the face is that
of a Bismarck without strength of character.</p>
<p>In speaking of Oxford before the civil war, let us not forget
that true students and peaceable men found a welcome retreat
beyond the din of theological fictions.&nbsp; Lord
Falkland&rsquo;s house was within ten miles of the town.&nbsp;
&lsquo;In this time,&rsquo; says Clarendon, in his immortal
panegyric, &lsquo;in this time he contracted familiarity and
friendship with the most polished men of the University, who
found such an immenseness of wit and such a solidity of judgment
in him, so infinite a fancy, bound in by a most logical
ratiocination, such a vast knowledge that he was not ignorant in
anything, yet such an excessive humility as if he had known
nothing, that they frequently resorted and dwelt with him, as in
a college situated in a purer air; so that his house was a
university in a less volume, whither they came not so much for
repose as study; and to examine and refine those grosser
propositions, which laziness and consent made current in vulgar
conversation.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The signs of the times grew darker.&nbsp; In 1636 the King and
Queen visited Oxford, &lsquo;with no applause.&rsquo;&nbsp; In
1640 Laud sent the University his last present of
manuscripts.&nbsp; He was charged with many offences.&nbsp; He
had repaired crucifixes; he had allowed the &lsquo;scandalous
image&rsquo; to be set up in the porch of St. Mary&rsquo;s; and
Alderman Nixon, the Puritan grocer, had seen a man bowing to the
scandalous image&mdash;so he declared.&nbsp; In 1642 Charles
asked for money from the colleges, for the prosecution of the war
with the Parliament.&nbsp; The beautiful old college plate began
its journey to the melting-pot.&nbsp; On August 9th the scholars
armed themselves.&nbsp; There were two bands of musqueteers, one
of pikemen, one of halberdiers.&nbsp; In the reign of Henry <span
class="GutSmall">III.</span> the men had been on the other
side.&nbsp; Magdalen bridge was blocked up with heaps of
wood.&nbsp; Stones, for the primitive warfare of the time, were
transported to the top of Magdalen tower.&nbsp; The stones were
never thrown at any foemen.&nbsp; Royalists and Roundheads in
turn occupied the place; and while grocer Nixon fled before the
Cavaliers, he came back and interceded for All Souls College
(which dealt with him for figs and sugar) when the Puritans
wished to batter the graven images on the gate.&nbsp; On October
29th the King came, after Edgehill fight, the Court assembled,
and Oxford was fortified.&nbsp; The place was made impregnable in
those days of feeble artillery.&nbsp; The author of the <i>Gesta
Stephani</i> had pointed out, many centuries before, that Oxford,
if properly defended, could never be taken, thanks to the network
of streams that surrounds her.&nbsp; Though the citizens worked
grudgingly and slowly, the trenches were at last completed.&nbsp;
The earthworks&mdash;a double line&mdash;ran in and out of the
interlacing streams.&nbsp; A Parliamentary force on Headington
Hill seems to have been unable to play on the city with
artillery.&nbsp; Barbed arrows were served out to the scholars,
who formed a regiment of more than six hundred men.&nbsp; The
Queen held her little court in Merton, in the Warden&rsquo;s
lodgings.&nbsp; Clarendon gives rather a humorous account of the
discontent of the fine ladies &lsquo;The town was full of lords
(besides those of the Council), and of persons of the best
quality, with very many ladies, who, when not pleased themselves,
kept others from being so.&rsquo;&nbsp; Oxford never was so busy
and so crowded; letters, society, war, were all confused; there
were excursions against Brown at Abingdon, and alarms from
Fairfax on Headington Hill.&nbsp; The siege, from May 22nd to
June 5th, was almost a farce.&nbsp; The Parliamentary generals
&lsquo;fought with perspective glasses.&rsquo;&nbsp; Neither
Cromwell at Wytham, nor Brown at Wolvercot, pushed matters too
hard.&nbsp; When two Puritan regiments advanced on Hinksey, Mr.
Smyth blazed away at them from his house.&nbsp; As in Zululand,
any building made a respectable fort, when cannon-balls had so
little penetrative power, or when artillery was not at the
front.&nbsp; Oxford was surrendered, with other places of arms,
after Naseby, and&mdash;Presbyterians became heads of
colleges!</p>

<span class="GutSmall">SOME SCHOLARS OF THE
RESTORATION</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">In</span> Merton Chapel a little mural
tablet bears the crest, the name, and the dates of the birth and
death, of Antony Wood.&nbsp; He has been our guide in these
sketches of Oxford life, as he must be the guide of the gravest
and most exact historians.&nbsp; No one who cares for the past of
the University should think without pity and friendliness of this
lonely scholar, who in his lifetime was unpitied and
unbefriended.&nbsp; We have reached the period in which he lived
and died, in the midst of changes of Church and State, and
surrounded by more worldly scholars, whose letters remain to
testify that, in the reign of the Second Charles, Oxford was
modern Oxford.&nbsp; In the epistles of Humphrey Prideaux,
student of Christ Church, we recognise the foibles of the modern
University, the love of gossip, the internecine criticism, the
greatness of little men whom <i>rien ne peut plaire</i>.</p>
<p>Antony Wood was a scholar of a different sort, of a sort that
has never been very common in Oxford.&nbsp; He was a perfect
dungeon of books; but he wrote as well as read, which has never
been a usual practice in his University.&nbsp; Wood was born in
1632, in one of the old houses opposite Merton, perhaps in the
curious ancient hall which has been called Beham, Bream, and
<i>Bohemi&aelig; Aula</i>, by various corruptions of the original
spelling.&nbsp; As a boy, Wood must have seen the siege of
Oxford, which he describes not without humour.&nbsp; As a young
man, he watched the religious revolution which introduced
Presbyterian Heads of Houses, and sent Puritanical captains of
horse, like Captain James Wadsworth, to hunt for
&lsquo;Papistical reliques&rsquo; and &lsquo;massing
stuffs&rsquo; among the property of the President of C. C. C. and
the Dean of Ch. Ch. (1646&ndash;1648).&nbsp; In 1650 he saw the
Chancellorship of Oliver Cromwell; in 1659 he welcomed the
Restoration, and rejoiced that &lsquo;the King had come to his
own again.&rsquo;&nbsp; The tastes of an antiquary combined, with
the natural reaction against Puritanism, to make Antony Wood a
High Churchman, and not averse to Rome, while he had sufficient
breadth of mind to admire Thomas Hobbes, the patriarch of English
learning.&nbsp; But Wood had little room in his heart or mind for
any learning save that connected with the University.&nbsp;
Oxford, the city, and the colleges, the remains of the old
religious art, the customs, the dresses&mdash;these things he
adored with a loverlike devotion, which was utterly
unrewarded.&nbsp; He owed no office to the University, and he was
even expelled (1693) for having written sharply against
Clarendon.&nbsp; This did not abate his zeal, nor prevent him
from passing all his days, and much of his nights, in the study
and compilation of University history.</p>
<p>The author of Wood&rsquo;s biography has left a picture of his
sombre and laborious old age.&nbsp; He rose at four o&rsquo;clock
every morning.&nbsp; He scarcely tasted food till
supper-time.&nbsp; At the hour of the college dinner he visited
the booksellers&rsquo; shops, where he was sure not to be
disturbed by the gossip of dons, young and old.&nbsp; After
supper he would smoke his pipe and drink his pot of ale in a
tavern.&nbsp; It was while he took this modest refreshment,
before old age came upon him, that Antony once fell in, and fell
out, with Dick Peers.&nbsp; This Dick was one of the men employed
by Dr. Fell, the Dean of Ch. Ch., to translate Wood&rsquo;s
History and Antiquities of the University of Oxford into
Latin.&nbsp; The translation gave rise to a number of literary
quarrels.&nbsp; As Dean of Ch. Ch., Dr. Fell yielded to the
besetting sin of deans, and fancied himself the absolute master
of the University, if not something superior to mortal
kind.&nbsp; An autocrat of this sort had no scruples about
changing Wood&rsquo;s copy whenever he differed from Wood in
political or religious opinion.&nbsp; Now Antony, as we said, had
eyes to discern the greatness of Hobbes, whom the Dean considered
no better than a Deist or an Atheist.&nbsp; The Dean therefore
calmly altered all that Wood had written of the Philosopher of
Malmesbury, and so maligned Hobbes that the old man, meeting the
King in Pall Mall, begged leave to reply in his own
defence.&nbsp; Charles allowed the dispute to go on, and Hobbes
hit Fell rather hard.&nbsp; The Dean retorted with the famous
expression about <i>irritabile illud et vanissimum Malmesburiense
animal</i>.&nbsp; This controversy amused Oxford, but bred bad
feeling between Antony Wood and Dick Peers, the translator of his
work, and the tool of the Dean of Ch. Ch.&nbsp; Prideaux
(<i>Letters to John Ellis</i>; Camden Society, 1875) describes
the battles in city taverns between author and translator:</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;I suppose that you have heard of the
continuall feuds, and often battles, between the author and the
translator; they had a skirmish at Sol Hardeing [keeper of a
tavern in All Saints&rsquo; parish], another at the printeing
house [the Sheldonian theatre], and several other
places.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>From the record of these combats, we learn that the recluse
Antony was a man of his hands:</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;As Peers always cometh off with a bloody
nose or a black eye, he was a long time afraid to goe annywhere
where he might chance to meet his too powerful adversary, for
fear of another drubbing, till he was pro-proctor, and now Woods
(<i>sic</i>) is as much afraid to meet him, least he should
exercise his authority upon him.&nbsp; And although he be a good
bowzeing blad, yet it hath been observed that never since his
adversary hath been in office hath he dared to be out after nine,
least he should meet him and exact the rigor of the statute upon
him.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The statute required all scholars to be in their rooms before
Tom had ceased ringing.&nbsp; It was, perhaps, too rash to say
that the Oxford of the Restoration was already modern
Oxford.&nbsp; The manners of the students were, so to speak, more
accentuated.&nbsp; However much the lecturer in Idolology may
dislike the method and person of the Reader in the Mandingo
language, these two learned men do not box in taverns, nor take
off their coats if they meet each other at the Clarendon
Press.&nbsp; People are careful not to pitch into each other in
that way, though the temper which confounds opponents for their
theory of irregular verbs is not at all abated.&nbsp; As Wood
grew in years he did not increase in honours.&nbsp; &lsquo;He was
a mere scholar,&rsquo; and consequently might expect from the
greater number of men disrespect.&nbsp; When he was but
sixty-four, he looked eighty at least.&nbsp; His dress was not
elegant, &lsquo;cleanliness being his chief object.&rsquo;&nbsp;
He rarely left his rooms, that were papered with MSS., and where
every table and chair had its load of books and yellow parchments
from the College muniment rooms.&nbsp; When strangers came to
Oxford with letters of recommendation, the recluse would leave
his study, and gladly lead them about the town, through Logic
Lane to Queen&rsquo;s, which had not then the sublimely classical
front, built by Hawksmoor, &lsquo;but suggested by Sir
Christopher Wren.&rsquo;&nbsp; It is worthy of his genius.&nbsp;
Wood died in 1695, &lsquo;forgiving every one.&rsquo;&nbsp; He
could well afford to do so.&nbsp; In his <i>Athen&aelig;
Oxonienses</i> he had written the lives of all his enemies.</p>
<p>Wood, &lsquo;being a mere scholar,&rsquo; could, of course,
expect nothing but disrespect in a place like Oxford.&nbsp; His
younger contemporary, Humphrey Prideaux, was, in the Oxford
manner, a man of the world.&nbsp; He was the son of a Cornish
squire, was educated at Westminster under Busby (that awful
pedagogue, whose birch seems so near a memory), got a studentship
at Christ Church in 1668, and took his B.A. degree in 1672.&nbsp;
Here it may be observed that men went up quite as late in life
then as they do now, for Prideaux was twenty-four years old when
he took his degree.&nbsp; Fell was Dean of Christ Church, and was
showing laudable zeal in working the University Press.&nbsp; What
a pity it is that the University Press of to-day has become a
trading concern, a shop for twopenny manuals and penny
primers!&nbsp; It is scarcely proper that the University should
at once organise examinations and sell the manuals which contain
the answers to the questions most likely to be set.&nbsp; To
return to Fell; he made Prideaux edit Lucius Florus, and publish
the <i>Marmora Oxoniensia</i>, which came out 1676.&nbsp; We must
not suppose, however, that Prideaux was an enthusiastic
arch&aelig;ologist.&nbsp; He did the <i>Marmora</i> because the
Dean commanded it, and because educated people were at that
period not uninterested in Greek art.&nbsp; At the present hour
one may live a lifetime in Oxford and only learn, by the accident
of examining passmen in the Arundel Room, that the University
possesses any marbles.&nbsp; In the walls of the Arundel Room (on
the ground-floor in the Schools&rsquo; quadrangle) these touching
remains of Hellas are interred.&nbsp; There are the funereal
stel&aelig;, with their quiet expression of sorrow, of hope, of
resignation.&nbsp; The young man, on his tombstone, is
represented in the act of rising and taking the hand of a
friend.&nbsp; He is bound on his latest journey.</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;He goeth forth unto the unknown land,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Where wife nor child may follow; thus far tell<br />
The lingering clasp of hand in faithful hand,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And that brief carven legend, <i>Friend</i>,
<i>farewell</i>.</p>
<p>O pregnant sign, profound simplicity!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; All passionate pain and fierce remonstrating<br />
Being wholly purged, leave this mere memory,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Deep but not harsh, a sad and sacred thing.&rsquo;

<p>The lady chooses from a coffer a trinket, or a ribbon.&nbsp;
It is her last toilette she is making, with no fear and no
regret.&nbsp; Again, the long-severed souls are meeting with
delight in the home of the just made perfect.</p>

<p>Even in the Schools these scraps of Greek lapidary&rsquo;s
work seem beautiful to us, in their sober and cheerful acceptance
of life and death.&nbsp; We hope, in Oxford, that the study of
ancient art, as well as of ancient literature, may soon be made
possible.&nbsp; These tangible relics of the past bring us very
near to the heart and the life of Greece, and waken a kindly
enthusiasm in every one who approaches them.&nbsp; In Humphrey
Prideaux&rsquo;s letters there is not a trace of any such
feeling.&nbsp; He does his business, but it is hack-work.&nbsp;
In this he differs from the modern student, but in his caustic
description of the rude and witless society of the place he is
modern enough.&nbsp; In his letters to his friend, John Ellis, of
the State Paper Office, it is plain that Prideaux wants to get
preferment.&nbsp; His taste and his ambition alike made him
detest the heavy, beer-drinking doctors, the fast &lsquo;All
Souls gentlemen,&rsquo; and the fossils of stupidity who are
always plentifully imbedded in the soil of University life.&nbsp;
Fellowships were then sold, at Magdalen and New, when they were
not given by favour.&nbsp; Prideaux grumbles (July 28th, 1674) at
the laxness of the Commissioners, who should have exposed this
abuse: &lsquo;In town, one of their inquirys is whether any of
the scholars weare pantaloons or periwigues, or keep
dogs.&rsquo;&nbsp; The great dispute about dogs, which raged at a
later date in University College, had already begun to disturb
dons and undergraduates.&nbsp; The choice language of Oxford
contempt was even then extant, and Prideaux, like Grandison in
<i>Daniel Deronda</i>, spoke curtly of the people whom he did not
like as &lsquo;brutes.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Pembroke&mdash;the
fittest colledge in the town for brutes.&rsquo;&nbsp; The
University did not encourage certain &lsquo;players&rsquo; who
had paid the place a visit, and the players, in revenge, had gone
about the town at night and broken the windows.</p>
<p>When the journey from London to Oxford is so easily performed,
it is amusing to read of Prideaux&rsquo;s miserable adventures,
in the diligence, between a lady of easy manners, a
&lsquo;pitiful rogue,&rsquo; and two undergraduates who
&lsquo;sordidly affected debauchery.&rsquo;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;This ill company made me very miserable all
the way.&nbsp; Only once I could not but heartily laugh to see
Fincher be sturdyly belaboured by five or six carmen with whips
and prong staves for provoking them with some of his extravagant
frolics.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The &lsquo;violent affection to vice&rsquo; in the University,
or in the country, was, of course, the reaction against the
godliness of Puritan captains of horse.&nbsp; Another form of the
reaction is discernible in the revived High Church sentiments of
Prideaux, Wood, and most of the students of the time.</p>
<p>The manners of the undergraduates were not much better than
those of the pot-house-haunting seniors.&nbsp; Dr. Good, the
Master of Balliol, &lsquo;a good old toast,&rsquo; had much
trouble with his students.</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;There is, over against Balliol College, a
dingy, horrid, scandalous ale-house, fit for none but draymen and
tinkers, and such as, by going there, have made themselves
equally scandalous.&nbsp; Here the Balliol men continually, and
by perpetuall bubbing, add art to their natural stupidity, to
make themselves perfect sots.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The envy and jealousy of the inferior colleges, alas! have put
about many things, in these latter days, to the discredit of the
Balliol men, but not even Humphrey Prideaux would, out of all his
stock of epithets, choose &lsquo;sottish&rsquo; and
&lsquo;stupid.&rsquo;&nbsp; In these old times, however, Dr. Good
had to call the men together, and&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Inform them of the mischiefs of that
hellish liquor called ale; but one of them, not so tamely to be
preached out of his beloved liquor, made answer that the
Vice-Chancelour&rsquo;s men drank ale at the &ldquo;Split
Crow,&rdquo; and why should not they too?&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On this, old Dr. Good posted off to the Vice-Chancellor, who,
&lsquo;being a lover of old ale&rsquo; himself, returned a short
answer to the head of Balliol.&nbsp; The old man went back to his
college, and informed his fellows, &lsquo;that he was assured
there were no hurt in ale, so that now they may be sots by
authority.&rsquo;&nbsp; Christ Church men were not more
sober.&nbsp; David Whitford, who had been the tutor of Shirley
the poet, was found lying dead in his bed: &lsquo;he had been
going to take a dram for refreshment, but death came between the
cup and the lips, and this is the end of Davy.&rsquo;&nbsp;
Prideaux records, in the same feeling style, that smallpox
carried off many of the undergraduates, &lsquo;besides my
brother,&rsquo; a student at Corpus.</p>
<p>The University Press supplied Prideaux with gossip.&nbsp; They
printed &lsquo;a book against Hobs,&rsquo; written by
Clarendon.&nbsp; Hobbes was the heresiarch of the time, and when
an unhappy fellow of Merton hanged himself, the doctrines of
Hobbes were said to have prompted him to the deed.&nbsp; To
return to the Press.&nbsp; &lsquo;Our Christmas book will be
Cornelius Nepos . . . Our marbles are now printing.&rsquo;&nbsp;
Prideaux, as has been said, took no interest in his own work.</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;I coat (quote) a multitude of authors; if
people think the better of me for that, I will think the worse of
them for their judgement.&nbsp; It beeing soe easyly a thinge to
make this specious show, he must be a fool that cannot gain
whatsoever repute is to be gotten by it.&nbsp; If people will
admire him for this, they may; I shall admire such for nothing
else but their good indexs.&nbsp; As long as books have these, on
what subject may we not coat as many others as we please, and
never have read one of them?&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is not easy to gather from this confession whether Prideaux
had or had not read the books he &lsquo;coated.&rsquo;&nbsp; It
is certain that Dean Aldrich (and here again we recognise the
eternal criticism of modern Oxford) held a poor opinion of
Humphrey Prideaux.&nbsp; Aldrich said Prideaux was
&lsquo;incorrect,&rsquo; &lsquo;muddy-headed,&rsquo; &lsquo;he
would do little or nothing besides heaping up notes&rsquo;;
&lsquo;as for MSS. he would not trouble himself about any, but
rest wholly upon what had been done to his hands by former
editors.&rsquo;&nbsp; This habit of carping, this trick of
collecting notes, this inability to put a work through, this
dawdling erudition, this horror of manuscripts, every Oxford man
knows them, and feels those temptations which seem to be in the
air.&nbsp; Oxford is a discouraging place.&nbsp; College drudgery
absorbs the hours of students in proportion to their
conscientiousness.&nbsp; They have only the waste odds-and-ends
of time for their own labours.&nbsp; They live in an atmosphere
of criticism.&nbsp; They collect notes, they wait, they dream;
their youth goes by, and the night comes when no man can
work.&nbsp; The more praise to the tutors and lecturers who
decipher the records of Assyria, or patiently collate the
manuscripts of the <i>Iliad</i>, who not only teach what is
already known, but add to the stock of knowledge, and advance the
boundaries of scholarship and science.</p>
<p>One lesson may be learned from Prideaux&rsquo;s cynical
letters, which is still worth the attention of every young Oxford
student who is conscious of ambition, of power, and of real
interest in letters.&nbsp; He can best serve his University by
coming out of her, by declining college work, and by devoting
himself to original study in some less exhausted air, in some
less critical society.</p>
<p>Among the aversions of Humphrey Prideaux were the
&lsquo;gentlemen of All Souls.&rsquo;&nbsp; They certainly showed
extraordinary impudence when they secretly employed the
University Press to print off copies of Marc Antonio&rsquo;s
engravings after Giulio Romano&rsquo;s drawings.&nbsp; It chanced
that Fell visited the press rather late one evening, and found
&lsquo;his press working at such an imployment.&nbsp; The prints
and plates he hath seased, and threatened the owners of them with
expulsion.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;All Souls,&rsquo; adds Prideaux,
&lsquo;is a scandalous place.&rsquo;&nbsp; Yet All Souls was the
college of young Mr. Guise, an Arabic scholar, &lsquo;the
greatest miracle in the knowledge of that I ever heard
of.&rsquo;&nbsp; Guise died of smallpox while still very
young.</p>
<p>Thus Prideaux prattles on, about Admiral Van Tromp, &lsquo;a
drunken greazy Dutchman,&rsquo; whom Speed, of St. John&rsquo;s,
conquered in boozing; of the disputes about races in Port Meadow;
of the breaking into the Mermaid Tavern.&nbsp; &lsquo;We Christ
Church men bear the blame of it, our ticks, as the noise of the
town will have it, amounting to &pound;1,500.&rsquo;&nbsp; Thus
Christ Church had little cause to throw the first stone at
Balliol.&nbsp; Prideaux shows little interest in letters, little
in the press, though he lived in palmy days of printing, in the
time of the Elzevirs; none at all in the educational work of the
place.&nbsp; He sneers at the Puritans, and at the controversy on
&lsquo;The Foundations of Hell Torments shaken and
removed.&rsquo;&nbsp; He admits that Locke &lsquo;is a man of
very good converse,&rsquo; but is chiefly concerned to spy out
the movements of the philosopher, suspected of sedition, and to
report them to Ellis in town.&nbsp; About the new buildings, as
of the beautiful western gateway, where Great Tom is hung, the
work of Wren, Prideaux says little; St. Mary&rsquo;s was
suffering restoration, and &lsquo;the old men,&rsquo; including
Wood, we may believe, &lsquo;exceedingly exclaim against
it.&rsquo;&nbsp; That is the way of Oxford, a college is
constantly rebuilding amid the protests of the rest of the
University.&nbsp; There is no question more common, or less
agreeable than this, &lsquo;What are you doing to your
tower?&rsquo; or &lsquo;What are you doing to your hall, library,
or chapel?&rsquo;&nbsp; No one ever knows; but we are always
doing something, and working men for ever sit, and drink beer, on
the venerable roofs.</p>
<p>Long intercourse with Prideaux&rsquo;s letters, and mournful
memories of Oxford new buildings, tempt a writer to imitate
Prideaux&rsquo;s spirit.&nbsp; Let us shut up his book, where he
leaves Oxford, in 1686, to become rector of Saham-Toney, in
Norfolk, and marry a wife, though, says he, &lsquo;I little
thought I should ever come to this.&rsquo;</p>
<h2><a name="page133"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
133</span>CHAPTER VI<br />
<span class="GutSmall">HIGH TORY OXFORD</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> name of her late Majesty Queen
Anne has for some little time been a kind of party
watch-word.&nbsp; Many harmless people have an innocent loyalty
to this lady, make themselves her knights (as Mary Antoinette has
still her sworn champions in France and Mary Stuart in Scotland),
buy the plate of her serene period, and imitate the dress.&nbsp;
To many moral critics in the press, however, Queen Anne is a kind
of abomination.&nbsp; I know not how it is, but the terms
&lsquo;Queen Anne furniture and blue china&rsquo; have become
words of almost slanderous railing.&nbsp; Any didactic journalist
who uses them is certain at once to fall heavily on the artistic
reputation of Mr. Burne Jones, to rebuke the philosophy of Mr.
Pater, and to hint that the entrance-hall of the Grosvenor
Gallery is that &lsquo;by-way&rsquo; with which Bunyan has made
us familiar.&nbsp; In the changes of things our admiration of the
Augustan age of our literature, the age of Addison and Steele, of
Marlborough and Aldrich, has become a sort of reproach.&nbsp; It
may be that our modern preachers know but little of that which
they traduce.&nbsp; At all events, the Oxford of Queen
Anne&rsquo;s time was not what they call
&lsquo;un-English,&rsquo; but highly conservative, and as dull
and beer-bemused as the most manly taste could wish it to be.</p>
<p>The <i>Spectator</i> of the ingenious Sir Richard Steele gives
us many a glimpse of non-juring Oxford.&nbsp; The old fashion of
Sanctity (Mr. Addison says, in the <i>Spectator</i>, No. 494) had
passed away; nor were appearances of Mirth and Pleasure looked
upon as the Marks of a Carnal Mind.&nbsp; Yet the Puritan Rule
was not so far forgotten, but that Mr. Anthony Henley (a
Gentleman of Property) could remember how he had stood for a
Fellowship in a certain College whereof a great Independent
Minister was Governor.&nbsp; As Oxford at this Moment is much
vexed in her Mind about Examinations, wherein, indeed, her whole
Force is presently expended, I make no scruple to repeat the
account of Mr. Henley&rsquo;s Adventure:</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;The Youth, according to Custom, waited on
the Governor of his College, to be examined.&nbsp; He was
received at the Door by a Servant, who was one of that gloomy
Generation that were then in Fashion.&nbsp; He conducted him with
great Silence and Seriousness to a long Gallery which was
darkened at Noon-day, and had only a single Candle burning in
it.&nbsp; After a short stay in this melancholy Apartment, he was
led into a Chamber hung with black, where he entertained himself
for some time by the glimmering of a Taper, till at length the
Head of the College came out to him from an inner Room, with half
a dozen Night Caps upon his Head, and a religious Horror in his
Countenance.&nbsp; The Young Man trembled; but his Fears
increased when, instead of being asked what progress he had made
in Learning, he was ask&rsquo;d &ldquo;how he abounded in
Grace?&rdquo;&nbsp; His <i>Latin</i> and <i>Greek</i> stood him
in little stead.&nbsp; He was to give an account only of the
state of his Soul&mdash;whether he was of the Number of the
Elect; what was the Occasion of his Conversion; upon what Day of
the Month and Hour of the Day it happened; how it was carried on,
and when completed.&nbsp; The whole Examination was summed up in
one short Question, namely, <i>Whether he was prepared for
Death</i>?&nbsp; The Boy, who had been bred up by honest Parents,
was frighted out of his wits by the solemnity of the Proceeding,
and by the last dreadful Interrogatory, so that, upon making his
Escape out of this House of Mourning, he could never be brought a
second Time to the Examination, as not being able to go through
the Terrors of it.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>By the year 1705, when Tom Hearne, of St. Edmund&rsquo;s Hall,
began to keep his diary, the &lsquo;honest folk&rsquo;&mdash;that
is, the High Churchmen&mdash;had the better of the Independent
Ministers.&nbsp; The Dissenters had some favour at Court, but in
the University they were looked upon as utterly reprobate.&nbsp;
From the <i>Reliqui&aelig;</i> of Hearne (an antiquarian
successor of Antony Wood, a <i>bibliophile</i>, an
arch&aelig;ologist, and as honest a man as Jacobitism could make
him) let us quote an example of Heaven&rsquo;s wrath against
Dissenters:</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;<i>Aug.</i> 6, 1706.&nbsp; We have an
account from Whitchurch, in Shropshire, that the Dissenters there
having prepared a great quantity of bricks to erect a spacious
conventicle, a destroying angel came by night and spoiled them
all, and confounded their Babel in the beginning, to their great
mortification.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hearne&rsquo;s common-place books are an amusing source of
information about Oxford society in the years of Queen Anne, and
of the Hanoverian usurper.&nbsp; Tom Hearne was a Master of Arts
of St. Edmund&rsquo;s Hall, and at one time Deputy-Librarian of
the Bodleian.&nbsp; He lost this post because he would not take
&lsquo;the wicked oaths&rsquo; required of him, but he did not
therefore leave Oxford.&nbsp; His working hours were passed in
preparing editions of antiquarian books, to be printed in very
limited number, on ordinary and <span class="smcap">Large
Paper</span>.&nbsp; It was the joy of Tom&rsquo;s existence to
see his editions become first scarce, then <span
class="smcap">Very Scarce</span>, while the price augmented in
proportion to the rarity.&nbsp; When he was not reading in his
rooms he was taking long walks in the country, tracing Roman
walls and roads, and exploring Woodstock Park for the remains of
&lsquo;the labyrinth,&rsquo; as he calls the Maze of Fair
Rosamund.&nbsp; In these strolls he was sometimes accompanied by
undergraduates, even gentlemen of noble family, &lsquo;which gave
cause to some to envy our happiness.&rsquo;&nbsp; Hearne was a
social creature, and had a heart, as he shows by the entry about
the death of his &lsquo;very dear friend, Mr. Thomas Cherry,
A.M., to the great grief of all that knew him, being a gentleman
of great beauty, singular modesty, of wonderful good nature, and
most excellent principles.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The friends of Hearne were chiefly, perhaps solely, what he
calls &lsquo;honest men,&rsquo; supporters of the Stuart family,
and always ready to drink his Majesty&rsquo;s (King James&rsquo;)
health.&nbsp; They would meet in &lsquo;Antiquity Hall,&rsquo; an
old house near Wadham, and smoke their honest pipes.&nbsp; They
held certain of the opinions of &lsquo;the Hebdomadal
Meeting,&rsquo; satirised by Steele in the <i>Spectator</i> (No.
43).&nbsp; &lsquo;We are much offended at the Act for importing
<i>French</i> wines.&nbsp; A bottle or two of good solid Edifying
Port, at honest <i>George&rsquo;s</i>, made a Night cheerful, and
threw off Reserve.&nbsp; But this plaguy <i>French</i> Claret
will not only cost us more Money but do us less
good.&rsquo;&nbsp; Hearne had a poor opinion of &lsquo;Captain
Steele,&rsquo; and of &lsquo;one Tickle: this Tickle is a
pretender to poetry.&rsquo;&nbsp; He admits that, though
&lsquo;Queen&rsquo;s people are angry at the <i>Spectator</i>,
and the common-room say &rsquo;tis silly dull stuff, men that are
indifferent commend it highly, as it deserves.&rsquo;&nbsp; Some
other satirist had a plate etched, representing Antiquity
Hall&mdash;a caricature of Tom&rsquo;s antiquarian
engravings.&nbsp; It may be seen in Skelton&rsquo;s book.</p>
<p>Thanks to Hearne, it is easy to reproduce the common-room
gossip, and the more treasonable talk of honest men at Antiquity
Hall.&nbsp; The learned were much interested, as they usually are
at Oxford, in theological discussion.&nbsp; Some one proved, by
an ingenious syllogism, that all men are to be saved; but Hearne
had the better of this Latitudinarian, easily demonstrating that
the comfortable argument does not meet the case of madmen, and of
deaf-mutes, whom Tom did not expect to meet in a future
state.&nbsp; The ingenious, though depressing speculations of Mr.
Dodwell were also discussed: &lsquo;He makes the air the
receptacle of all souls, good and bad, and that they are under
the power of the D&mdash;l, he being prince of the
air.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;The less perfectly good&rsquo; hang out,
if we may say so, &lsquo;in the space between earth and the
clouds,&rsquo; all which is subtle, and creditable to Mr.
Dodwell&rsquo;s invention, but not susceptible of exact
demonstration.&nbsp; The whole controversy is an interesting
specimen of Queen Anne philosophy, which, with all respect for
the taste of the period, we need not wish to see revived.&nbsp;
The Bishop of Worcester, for example, &lsquo;expects the end of
the world about nine years hence.&rsquo;&nbsp; While the theology
of Oxford is being mentioned, the zeal of Dr. Miller, Regius
Professor of Greek, must not be forgotten.&nbsp; The learned
Professor endeavoured to convert, and even &lsquo;writ a Letter
to Mrs. Bracegirdle, giving her great encomiums (as having
himself been often to see plays acted whilst they continued here)
upon account of her excellent qualifications, and persuading her
to give over this loose way of living, and betake herself to such
a kind of life as was more innocent, and would gain her more
credit.&rsquo;&nbsp; The Professor&rsquo;s advice was wasted on
&lsquo;Bracegirdle the brown.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Politics were naturally much discussed in these doubtful
years, when the Stuarts, it was thought, had still a chance to
win their own again.&nbsp; In 1706, Tom says, &lsquo;The great
health now is &ldquo;The Cube of Three,&rdquo; which is the
number 27, i.e. the number of the protesting Lords.&rsquo;&nbsp;
The University was most devoted, as far as drinking toasts
constitutes loyalty.&nbsp; In Hearne&rsquo;s common-place book is
carefully copied out this &lsquo;Scotch Health to K.
J.&rsquo;:</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;He&rsquo;s o&rsquo;er the seas and far
awa&rsquo;,<br />
He&rsquo;s o&rsquo;er the seas and far awa&rsquo;;<br />
Altho&rsquo; his back be at the wa&rsquo;<br />
We&rsquo;ll drink his health that&rsquo;s far
awa&rsquo;.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The words live, and ring strangely out of that dusty
past.&nbsp; The song survives the throne, and sounds
pathetically, somehow, as one has heard it chanted, in days as
dead as the year 1711, at suppers that seem as ancient almost as
the festivities of Thomas Hearne.&nbsp; It is not unpleasant to
remember that the people who sang could also fight, and spilt
their blood as well as their &lsquo;edifying port.&rsquo;&nbsp;
If the Southern &lsquo;honest men&rsquo; had possessed hearts for
anything but tippling, the history of England would have been
different.</p>
<p>When &lsquo;the allyes and the French fought a bloudy battle
near Mons&rsquo; (1709, &lsquo;Malplaquet&rsquo;), the Oxford
honest men, like Colonel Henry Esmond, thought &lsquo;there was
not any the least reason of bragging.&rsquo;&nbsp; The young King
of England, under the character of the Chevalier St. George,
&lsquo;shewed abundance of undaunted courage and resolution, led
up his troups with unspeakable bravery, appeared in the utmost
dangers, and at last was wounded.&rsquo;&nbsp;
Marlborough&rsquo;s victories were sneered at, his new palace of
Blenheim was said to be not only ill-built, but haunted by signs
of evil omen.</p>
<p>It was not always safe to say what one thought about politics
at Oxford.&nbsp; One Mr. A. going to one Mr. Tonson, a barber,
put the barber and his wife in a ferment (they being rascally
Whigs) by maintaining that the hereditary right was in the P. of
W.&nbsp; Tonson laid information against the gentleman;
&lsquo;which may be a warning to honest men not to enter into
topicks of this nature with barbers.&rsquo;&nbsp; One would not
willingly, even now, discuss the foreign policy of her
Majesty&rsquo;s Ministers with the person who shaves one.&nbsp;
There are opportunities and temptations to which no decent person
should be wantonly exposed.&nbsp; The bad effect of Whiggery on
the temper was evident in this, that &lsquo;the Mohocks are all
of the Whiggish gang, and indeed all Whigs are looked upon as
such Mohocks, their principles and doctrines leading thus to all
manner of barbarity and inhumanity.&rsquo;&nbsp; So true is it
that Conservatives are all lovers of peace and quiet, that (May
29th, 1715) &lsquo;last night a good part of the Presbyterian
meeting-house in Oxford was pulled down.&nbsp; The people ran up
and down the streets, crying, <i>King James the Third</i>!&nbsp;
<i>The true king</i>!&nbsp; <i>No Usurper</i>.&nbsp; In the
evening they pulled a good part of the Quakers&rsquo; and
Anabaptists&rsquo; meeting-houses down.&nbsp; The heads of houses
have represented that it was begun by the Whiggs.&rsquo;&nbsp;
Probably the heads of houses reasoned on <i>&agrave; priori</i>
principles when they arrived at this remarkable conclusion.</p>

<p>In consequence of the honesty, frankness, and consistency of
his opinions, Mr. Hearne ran his head in danger when King George
came to the throne, which has ever since been happily settled in
the possession of the Hanoverian line.&nbsp; A Mr. Urry, a
Non-juror, had to warn him, saying, &lsquo;Do you not know that
they have a mind to hang you if they can, and that you have many
enemies who are very ready to do it?&rsquo;&nbsp; In spite of
this, Hearne, in his diaries, still calls George I. the Duke of
Brunswick, and the Whigs, &lsquo;that fanatical
crew.&rsquo;&nbsp; John, Duke of Marlborough, he styles
&lsquo;that villain the Duke.&rsquo;&nbsp; We have had enough,
perhaps, of Oxford politics, which were not much more prejudiced
in the days of the Duke than in those of Mr. Gladstone.&nbsp;
Hearne&rsquo;s allusions to the contemporary state of buildings
and of college manners are often rather instructive.&nbsp; In All
Souls the Whigs had a feast on the day of King Charles&rsquo;s
martyrdom.&nbsp; They had a dinner dressed of woodcock,
&lsquo;whose heads they cut off, in contempt of the memory of the
blessed martyr.&rsquo;&nbsp; These men were &lsquo;low Churchmen,
more shame to them.&rsquo;&nbsp; The All Souls men had already
given up the custom of wandering about the College on the night
of January 14th, with sticks and poles, in quest of the
mallard.&nbsp; That &lsquo;swopping&rsquo; bird, still justly
respected, was thought, for many ages, to linger in the college
of which he is the protector.&nbsp; But now all hope of
recovering him alive is lost, and it is reserved for the
excavator of the future to marvel over the fossil bones of the
&lsquo;swopping, swopping mallard.&rsquo;</p>
<p>As an example of the paganism of Queen Anne&rsquo;s
reign&mdash;quite a different thing from the
&lsquo;Neo-paganism&rsquo; which now causes so much anxiety to
the moral press-man&mdash;let us note the affecting instance of
Geffery Ammon.&nbsp; &lsquo;He was a merry companion, and his
conversation was much courted.&rsquo;&nbsp; Geffery had but
little sense of religion.&nbsp; He is now buried on the west side
of Binsey churchyard, near St. Margaret&rsquo;s well.&nbsp;
Geffery selected Binsey for the place of his sepulchre, because
he was partial to the spot, having often shot snipe there.&nbsp;
In order to moisten his clay, he desired his friend Will Gardner,
a boatman of Oxford, who was accustomed to row him down the
river, to put now and then a bottle of ale by his grave when he
came that way; an injunction which was punctually complied
with.</p>
<p>Oxford lost in Hearne&rsquo;s time many of her old
buildings.&nbsp; It is said, with a dreadful appearance of truth,
that Oxford is now to lose some of the few that are left.&nbsp;
Corpus and Merton, if they are not belied, mean to pull down the
old houses opposite Merton, halls and houses consecrated to the
memory of Antony Wood, and to build lecture-rooms <i>and houses
for married dons</i> on the site.&nbsp; The topic, for one who is
especially bound to pray for Merton (and who now does so with
unusual fervour), is most painful.&nbsp; A view of the
&lsquo;proposed new buildings,&rsquo; in the Exhibition of the
Royal Academy (1879), depresses the soul.&nbsp; In the same
spirit Hearne says (March 28th, 1671), &lsquo;It always grieves
me when I go through Queen&rsquo;s College, to see the ruins of
the old chapell next to High Street, the area of which now lies
open (the building being most of it pulled down) and trampled
upon by dogs, etc., as if the ground had never been
consecrated.&nbsp; Nor do the Queen&rsquo;s Coll. people take any
care, but rather laught at it when &rsquo;tis
mentioned.&rsquo;&nbsp; In 1722 &lsquo;the famous postern-gate
called the <i>Turl</i> Gate&rsquo; (a corruption for
<i>Thorold</i> Gate) was &lsquo;pulled down by one Dr. Walker,
who lived by it, and pretended that it was a detriment to his
house.&nbsp; As long ago as 1705, they had pulled down the
building of Peckwater quadrangle, in Ch. Ch.&rsquo;&nbsp;
Queen&rsquo;s also &lsquo;pulled down the old refectory, which
was on the west side of the old quadrangle, and was a fine old
structure that I used to admire much.&rsquo;&nbsp; It appears
that the College was also anxious to pull down the chamber of
King Henry V.&nbsp; This is a strange craze for destruction, that
some time ago endangered the beautiful library of Merton, a place
where one can fancy that Chaucer or Wyclif may have
studied.&nbsp; Oxford will soon have little left of the beauty
and antiquity of <i>Patey&rsquo;s Quad</i> in Merton, as
represented in our illustration.&nbsp; What the next generation
will think of the multitudinous new buildings, it is not hard to
conjecture.&nbsp; Imitative experiments, without style or fancy
in structure or decoration, and often more than medievally
uncomfortable, they will seem but evidences of Oxford&rsquo;s
love of destruction.&nbsp; People of Hearne&rsquo;s way of
thinking, people who respect antiquity, protest in vain, and,
like Hearne, must be content sadly to enjoy what is left of grace
and dignity.&nbsp; He died before Oxford had quite become the
Oxford of Gibbon&rsquo;s autobiography.</p>

<span class="GutSmall">GEORGIAN OXFORD</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Oxford</span> has usually been described
either by her lovers or her malcontents.&nbsp; She has suffered
the extremes of filial ingratitude and affection.&nbsp; There is
something in the place that makes all her children either adore
or detest her; and it is difficult, indeed, to pick out the truth
concerning her past social condition from the satires and the
encomiums.&nbsp; Nor is it easy to say what qualities in Oxford,
and what answering characteristics in any of her sons, will beget
the favourable or the unfavourable verdict.&nbsp; Gibbon, one
might have thought, saw the sunny, and Johnson the shady, side of
the University.&nbsp; With youth, and wealth, and liberty, with a
set of three beautiful rooms in that &lsquo;stately pile, the new
building of Magdalen College,&rsquo; Gibbon found nothing in
Oxford to please him&mdash;nothing to admire, nothing to
love.&nbsp; From his poor and lofty rooms in Pembroke Gate-tower
the hypochondriac Johnson&mdash;rugged, anxious, and conscious of
his great unemployed power&mdash;looked down on a much more
pleasant Oxford, on a city and on schools that he never ceased to
regard with affection.&nbsp; This contrast is found in the
opinions of our contemporaries.&nbsp; One man will pass his time
in sneering at his tutors and his companions, in turning
listlessly from study to study, in following false tendencies,
and picking up scraps of knowledge which he despises, and in
later life he will detest his University.&nbsp; There are wiser
and more successful students, who yet bear away a grudge against
the stately mother of us all, that so easily can disregard our
petty spleens and ungrateful rancour.&nbsp; Mr. Lowe&rsquo;s most
bitter congratulatory addresses to the &lsquo;happy Civil
Engineers,&rsquo; and his unkindest cuts at ancient history, and
at the old philosophies which &lsquo;on Argive heights divinely
sung,&rsquo; move her not at all.&nbsp; Meanwhile, the majority
of men are more kindly compact, and have more natural affections,
and on them the memory of their earliest friendships, and of that
beautiful environment which Oxford gave to their years of youth,
is not wholly wasted.</p>
<p>There are more Johnsons, happily, in this matter, than
Gibbons.&nbsp; There is little need to repeat the familiar story
of Johnson&rsquo;s life at Pembroke.&nbsp; He went up in the
October term of 1728, being then nineteen years of age, and
already full of that wide and miscellaneous classical reading
which the Oxford course, then as now, somewhat discouraged.&nbsp;
&lsquo;His figure and manner appeared strange&rsquo; to the
company in which he found himself; and when he broke silence it
was with a quotation from Macrobius.&nbsp; To his tutor&rsquo;s
lectures, as a later poet says, &lsquo;with freshman zeal he
went&rsquo;; but his zeal did not last out the discovery that the
tutor was &lsquo;a heavy man,&rsquo; and the fact that there was
&lsquo;sliding on Christ Church Meadow.&rsquo;&nbsp; Have any of
the artists who repeat, with perseverance, the most famous scenes
in the Doctor&rsquo;s life&mdash;drawn him sliding on Christ
Church meadows, sliding in these worn and clouted shoes of his,
and with that figure which even the exercise of skating could not
have made &lsquo;swan-like,&rsquo; to quote the young lady in
&lsquo;Pickwick&rsquo;?&nbsp; Johnson was &lsquo;sconced&rsquo;
in the sum of twopence for cutting lecture; and it is rather
curious that the amount of the fine was the same four hundred
years earlier, when Master Stoke, of Catte Hall (whose career we
touched on in the second of these sketches), deserted his
lessons.&nbsp; It was when he was thus sconced that Johnson made
that reply which Boswell preserves &lsquo;as a specimen of the
antithetical character of his wit&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;Sir, you
have sconced me twopence for non-attendance on a lecture not
worth a penny.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Sconcing seems to have been the penalty for offences very
various in degree.&nbsp; &lsquo;A young fellow of Balliol College
having, upon some discontent, cut his throat very dangerously,
the master of his College sent his servitor to the buttery-book
to sconce him five shillings; and,&rsquo; says the Doctor,
&lsquo;tell him that the next time he cuts his throat I&rsquo;ll
sconce him ten!&rsquo;&nbsp; This prosaic punishment might
perhaps deter some Werthers from playing with edged tools.</p>
<p>From Boswell&rsquo;s meagre account of Johnson&rsquo;s Oxford
career we gather some facts which supplement the description of
Gibbon.&nbsp; The future historian went into residence
twenty-three years after Johnson departed without taking his
degree.&nbsp; Gibbon was a gentleman commoner, and was permitted
by the easy discipline of Magdalen to behave just as he
pleased.&nbsp; He &lsquo;eloped,&rsquo; as he says, from Oxford,
as often as he chose, and went up to town, where he was by no
means the ideal of &lsquo;the Manly Oxonian in
London.&rsquo;&nbsp; The fellows of Magdalen, possessing a
revenue which private avarice might easily have raised to
&pound;30,000, took no interest in their pupils.&nbsp;
Gibbon&rsquo;s tutor read a few Latin plays with his pupil, in a
style of dry and literal translation.&nbsp; The other fellows,
less conscientious, passed their lives in tippling and tattling,
discussing the &lsquo;Oxford Toasts,&rsquo; and drinking other
toasts to the king over the water.&nbsp; &lsquo;Some
duties,&rsquo; says Gibbon, &lsquo;may possibly have been imposed
on the poor scholars,&rsquo; but &lsquo;the velvet cap was the
cap of liberty,&rsquo; and the gentleman commoner consulted only
his own pleasure.&nbsp; Johnson was a poor scholar, and on him
duties were imposed.&nbsp; He was requested to write an ode on
the Gunpowder Plot, and Boswell thinks &lsquo;his vivacity and
imagination must have produced something fine.&rsquo;&nbsp; He
neglected, however, with his usual indolence, this opportunity of
producing something fine.&nbsp; Another exercise imposed on the
poor was the translation of Mr. Pope&rsquo;s
&lsquo;Messiah,&rsquo; in which the young Pembroke man succeeded
so well that, by Mr. Pope&rsquo;s own generous confession, future
ages would doubt whether the English or the Latin piece was the
original.&nbsp; Johnson complained that no man could be properly
inspired by the Pembroke &lsquo;coll,&rsquo; or college beer,
which was then commonly drunk by undergraduates, still guiltless
of Rhine wines, and of collecting Chinese monsters.</p>
<blockquote><p><i>Carmina vis nostri scribant meliora
poet&aelig;</i><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Ingenium jubeas purior baustus alat</i>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In spite of the muddy beer, the poverty, and the
&lsquo;bitterness mistaken for frolic,&rsquo; with which Johnson
entertained the other undergraduates round Pembroke gate, he
never ceased to respect his college.&nbsp; &lsquo;His love and
regard for Pembroke he entertained to the last,&rsquo; while of
his old tutor he said, &lsquo;a man who becomes Jorden&rsquo;s
pupil becomes his son.&rsquo;&nbsp; Gibbon&rsquo;s sneer is a
foil to Johnson&rsquo;s kindliness.&nbsp; &lsquo;I applaud the
filial piety which it is impossible for me to imitate . . . To
the University of Oxford I acknowledge no obligations, and she
will as cheerfully renounce me for a son, as I am willing to
disclaim her for a mother.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Johnson was a man who could take the rough with the smooth,
and, to judge by all accounts, the Oxford of the earlier half of
the eighteenth century was excessively rough.&nbsp; Manners were
rather primitive: a big fire burned in the centre of Balliol
Hall, and round this fire, one night in every year, it is said
that all the world was welcome to a feast of ale and bread and
cheese.&nbsp; Every guest paid his shot by singing a song or
telling a story; and one can fancy Johnson sharing in this
barbaric hospitality.&nbsp; &lsquo;What learning can they have
who are destitute of all principles of civil behaviour?&rsquo;
says a writer from whose journal (printed in 1746) Southey has
made some extracts.&nbsp; The diarist was a Puritan of the old
leaven, who visited Oxford shortly before Johnson&rsquo;s period,
and who speaks of &lsquo;a power of gross darkness that may be
felt constantly prevailing in that place of wisdom and of
subtlety, but not of God . . . In this wicked place the scholars
are the rudest, most giddy, and unruly rabble, and most
mischievous.&rsquo;&nbsp; But this strange and unfriendly critic
was a Nonconformist, in times when good Churchmen showed their
piety by wrecking chapels and &lsquo;rabbling&rsquo;
ministers.&nbsp; In our days only the Davenport Brothers and
similar professors of strange creeds suffer from the manly piety
of the undergraduates.</p>
<p>Of all the carping, cross-grained, scandal-loving, Whiggish
assailants of <i>Alma Mater</i>, the author of <i>Terr&aelig;
Filius</i> was the most persistent.&nbsp; The first little volume
which contains the numbers of this bi-weekly periodical (printed
for R. Franklin, under Tom&rsquo;s Coffee-house, in Russell
Street, Covent Garden, <span class="GutSmall">MDCCXXVI.</span>)
is not at all rare, and is well worth a desultory reading.&nbsp;
What strikes one most in <i>Terr&aelig; Filius</i> is the
religious discontent of the bilious author.&nbsp; One thinks,
foolishly of course, of even Georgian Whigs as orthodox men, at
least in their undergraduate days.&nbsp; The mere aspect of Mr.
Leslie Stephen&rsquo;s work on the philosophers of the eighteenth
century is enough to banish this pleasing delusion.&nbsp; The
Deists and Freethinkers had their followers in Johnson&rsquo;s
day among the undergraduates, though scepticism, like Whiggery,
was unpopular, and might be punished.&nbsp; Johnson says, that
when he was a boy he was a lax <i>talker</i>, rather than a lax
<i>thinker</i>, against religion; &lsquo;but lax talking against
religion at Oxford would not be suffered.&rsquo;&nbsp; The author
of <i>Terr&aelig; Filius</i>, however, never omits a chance of
sneering at our faith, and at the Church of England as by law
established.&nbsp; In his description of the exercises of the
Club of Wits, only one respectably clever epigram is quoted,
beginning,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Since in religion all men disagree,<br />
And some one God believe, some thirty, and some three.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This production &lsquo;was voted heretical,&rsquo; and burned
by the hands of the small-beer drawer, while the author was
expelled.&nbsp; In the author&rsquo;s advice to freshmen, he
gives a not uninteresting sketch of these rudimentary
creatures.&nbsp; The chrysalis, as described by the preacher of a
University sermon, &lsquo;never, in his wildest moments, dreamed
of being a butterfly&rsquo;; but the public schoolboy of the last
century sometimes came up in what he conceived to be gorgeous
attire.&nbsp; &lsquo;I observe, in the first place, that you no
sooner shake off the authority of the birch but you affect to
distinguish yourselves from your dirty school-fellows by a new
drugget, a pair of prim ruffles, a new bob-wig, and a
brazen-hilted sword.&rsquo;&nbsp; As soon as they arrived in
Oxford, these youths were hospitably received &lsquo;amongst a
parcel of honest, merry fellows, who think themselves obliged, in
honour and common civility, to make you <i>damnable drunk</i>,
and carry you, as they call it, a <span
class="GutSmall">CORPSE</span> to bed.&rsquo;&nbsp; When this
period of jollity is ended, the freshman must declare his
views.&nbsp; He must see that he is in the fashion; &lsquo;and
let your declarations be, that you are <i>Churchmen</i>, and that
you believe as the <i>Church</i> believes.&nbsp; For instance,
you have subscribed the Thirty-nine Articles; but never venture
to explain the sense in which you subscribed them, because there
are various senses; so many, indeed, that scarce two men
understand them in the same, and no <i>true Churchman</i> in that
which the words bear, and in that which they were
written.&rsquo;</p>
<p>This is pretty plain speaking, and <i>Terr&aelig; Filius</i>
enforces, by an historical example, the dangers of even political
freethought.&nbsp; In 1714 the Constitution Club kept King
George&rsquo;s birthday.&nbsp; The Constitutional Party was then
the name which the Whigs took to themselves, though, thanks to
the advance of civilisation, the Tories have fallen back upon the
same.&nbsp; The Conservative undergraduates attacked the club,
sallying forth from their Jacobite stronghold in Brasenose (as
seen in our illustration), where the &lsquo;silly statue,&rsquo;
as Hearne calls it, was about that time erected.&nbsp; The Whigs
took refuge in Oriel, the Tories assaulted the gates, and an
Oriel man, firing out of his window, wounded a gownsman of
Brasenose.&nbsp; The Tories, &lsquo;under terror of this
dangerous and unexpected resistance, retreated from
Oriel.&rsquo;&nbsp; Yet such was the academic strength of the
Jacobites and the Churchmen, that a Freethinker, or a
&lsquo;Constitutioner,&rsquo; could scarcely take his degree.</p>
<p><i>Terr&aelig; Filius</i>, who lashes the dons for
covetousness, greed, dissipation, rudeness, and stupidity, often
corroborates the Puritan&rsquo;s report about the bad manners of
the undergraduates.&nbsp; Yet Oxford, then as now, did not lack
her exquisites, and her admirers of the fair.&nbsp;
<i>Terr&aelig; Filius</i> thus describes a &lsquo;smart,&rsquo;
as these dandies were called&mdash;Mr. Frippery:</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;He is one of those who come in their
academical undress, every morning between ten and eleven, to
Lyne&rsquo;s Coffee-house; after which he takes a turn or two
upon the park, or under Merton Wall, whilst the dull
<i>regulars</i> are at dinner in their hall, according to
statute; about one he dines alone in his chamber upon a boiled
chicken or some pettitoes; after which he allows himself an hour
at least to dress in, to make his afternoon&rsquo;s appearance at
Lyne&rsquo;s; from whence he adjourns to Hamilton&rsquo;s about
five; from whence (after strutting about the room for a while,
and drinking a dram of citron), he goes to chapel, to show how
genteelly he dresses, and how well he can chaunt.&nbsp; After
prayers he drinks tea with some celebrated toast, and then waits
upon her to Magdalen Grove or Paradise Garden, and back
again.&nbsp; He seldom eats any supper, and never reads anything
but novels and romances.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The dress of this hero and his friends must have made the
streets more gay than do the bright-coloured flannel coats of our
boating men.</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;He is easily distinguished by a stiff silk
gown, which rustles in the wind as he struts along; a flax
tie-wig, or sometimes a long natural one, which reaches down
below his [well, say below his waist]; a broad bully-cock&rsquo;d
hat, or a square cap of about twice the usual size; white
stockings; thin Spanish leather shoes.&nbsp; His clothes lined
with tawdry silk, and his shirt ruffled down the bosom as well as
at the wrists.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These &lsquo;smarts&rsquo; cut no such gallant figure when
they first arrived in Oxford, with their fathers (rusty old
country farmers), in linsey-woolsey coats, greasy, sun-burnt
heads of hair, clouted shoes, yarn stockings, flapping hats, with
silver hatbands, and long muslin neck-cloths run with red at the
bottom.</p>

</a></p>
<p>After this satire of the undergraduates we may look at the
contemporary account-book of a Proctor.&nbsp; In 1752 Gilbert
White of Selborne was Proctor, and may have fined young Gibbon of
Magdalen, who little thought that Oxford boasted an official who
was to become an English classic.&nbsp; White paid some attention
to dress, and got a feather-topp&rsquo;d, grizzled wig from
London; cost him &pound;2, 5s.&nbsp; He bought &lsquo;mountain
wine, very old and good,&rsquo; and had his crest engraved on his
teaspoons, that everything might be handsome about him.&nbsp;
When he treated the Masters of Arts in Oriel Hall they ate a
hundred pounds weight of biscuits&mdash;not, we trust, without
marmalade.&nbsp; &lsquo;A bowl of rum-punch from
Horsman&rsquo;s&rsquo; cost half a crown.&nbsp; Fancy a jolly
Proctor sending out for bowls of rum-punch, and that in
April!&nbsp; Eggs cost a penny each, and &lsquo;three oranges and
a mouse-trap&rsquo; ninepence.</p>
<p>White, a generous man, gave the Vice-Chancellor &lsquo;seven
pounds of double-refined white sugar.&rsquo;&nbsp; I like to
fancy my learned friend, the Proctor, going to the present
Vice-Chancellor&rsquo;s with a donation of white sugar!&nbsp;
Manners have certainly changed in the direction of
severity.&nbsp; &lsquo;Share of the expense for Mr.
Butcher&rsquo;s release&rsquo; came to ten and sixpence.&nbsp;
What had Mr. Butcher been doing?&nbsp; The Proctor went &lsquo;to
Blenheim with Nan,&rsquo; and it cost him fifteen and
sixpence.&nbsp; Perhaps she was one of the &lsquo;Oxford
Toasts&rsquo; of a contemporary satire.&nbsp; Strawberries were
fourpence a basket on the ninth of June; and on November 6, White
lost one shilling &lsquo;at cards, in common room.&rsquo;&nbsp;
He went from Selborne to Oxford, &lsquo;in a post-chaise with
Jenny Croke&rsquo;; and he gave Jenny a &lsquo;round
Chinaturene.&rsquo;&nbsp; Tea cost eight shillings a pound in
1752, while rum-punch was but half a crown a bowl.&nbsp;
White&rsquo;s highest terminal battels were but &pound;12, though
he was a hospitable man, and would readily treat the other
Proctor to a bowl of punch.&nbsp; It is well to remember White
and Johnson when the Gibbon of that or any other day bewails the
intellectual poverty of Oxford.</p>

171</span>CHAPTER VIII<br />
<span class="GutSmall">POETS AT OXFORD: SHELLEY AND
LANDOR</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">At</span> any given time a large number of
poets may be found among the undergraduates at Oxford, and the
younger dons.&nbsp; It is not easy to say what becomes of all
these pious bards, who are a marked and peculiar people while
they remain in residence.&nbsp; The undergraduate poet is a not
uninteresting study.&nbsp; He wears his hair long, and divides it
down the middle.&nbsp; His eye is wild and wandering, and his
manner absent, especially when he is called on to translate a
piece of an ancient author in lecture.&nbsp; He does not
&lsquo;read&rsquo; much, in the technical sense of the term, but
consumes all the novels that come in his way, and all the minor
poetry.&nbsp; His own verses the poet may be heard declaiming
aloud, at unholy midnight hours, so that his neighbours have been
known to break his windows with bottles, and then to throw in all
that remained of the cold meats of a supper party, without
interfering with the divine <i>afflatus</i>.&nbsp; When the
college poet has composed a sonnet, ode, or what not, he sends it
to the Editor of the <i>Nineteenth Century</i>, and it returns to
him after many days.&nbsp; At last it appears in print, in
<i>College Rhymes</i>, a collection of mild verse, which is (or
was) printed at regular or irregular intervals, and was never
seen except in the rooms of contributors.&nbsp; The poet also
speaks at the Union, where his sentiments are either
revolutionary, or so wildly conservative that he looks on Magna
Charta as the first step on the path that leads to
England&rsquo;s ruin.&nbsp; As a politician, the undergraduate
poet knows no mean between Mr. Peter Taylor and King John.&nbsp;
He has been known to found a Tory club, and shortly afterwards to
swallow the formul&aelig; of Mr. Bradlaugh.</p>
<p>The life of the poet is, not unnaturally, one long warfare
with his dons.&nbsp; He cannot conform himself to pedantic rules,
which demand his return to college before midnight.&nbsp; Though
often the possessor of a sweet vein of clerical and Kebleian
verse, the poet does not willingly attend chapel; for indeed, as
he sits up all night, it is cruel to expect him to arise before
noon.&nbsp; About the poet&rsquo;s late habits a story is told,
which seems authentic.&nbsp; A remarkable and famous contemporary
singer was known to his fellow-undergraduates only by this
circumstance, that his melodious voice was heard declaiming
anapaests all through the ambrosial night.&nbsp; When the voice
of the singer was lulled, three sharp taps were heard in the
silence.&nbsp; This noise was produced by the bard&rsquo;s Scotch
friend and critic in knocking the ashes out of his pipe.&nbsp;
These feasts of reason are almost incompatible with the early
devotion which, strangely enough, Shelley found time and
inclination to attend.</p>
<p>Now it is (or was) the belief of undergraduates that you might
break the decalogue and the laws of man in every direction with
safety and the approval of the dons, if you only went regularly
to chapel.&nbsp; As the poet cannot do this (unless he is a
&lsquo;sleepless man&rsquo;), his existence is a long struggle
with the fellows and tutors of his college.&nbsp; The manners of
poets vary, of course, with the tastes of succeeding
generations.&nbsp; I have heard of two (Thyrsis and Corydon)
&lsquo;who lived in Oxford as if it were a large
country-house.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Of other singers, the latest of the heavenly quire, it is
invidiously said that they build shrines to Blue China and other
ceramic abominations of the Philistine, and worship the same in
their rooms.&nbsp; Of this sort it is not the moment to
speak.&nbsp; Time has not proved them.&nbsp; But the old poets of
ten years ago lived a militant life; they rarely took good
classes (though they competed industriously for the Newdigate,
writing in the metre of <i>Dolores</i>), and it not uncommonly
happened that they left Oxford without degrees.&nbsp; They were
often very agreeable fellows, as long as one was in no way
responsible for them; but it was almost impossible&mdash;human
nature being what it is&mdash;that they should be much
appreciated by tutors, proctors, and heads of houses.&nbsp; How
could these worthy, learned, and often kind and courteous persons
know when they were dealing with a lad of genius, and when they
had to do with an affected and pretentious donkey?</p>
<p>These remarks are almost the necessary preface to a
consideration of the existence of Shelley and Landor at
Oxford&mdash;the Oxford of 1793&ndash;1810.&nbsp; Whatever the
effects may be on Shelleyan commentators, it must be said that,
to the donnish eye, Percy Bysshe Shelley was nothing more or less
than the ordinary Oxford poet, of the quieter type.&nbsp; In
Walter Savage Landor, authority recognised a noisier and rowdier
specimen of the same class.&nbsp; People who have to do with
hundreds of young men at a time are unavoidably compelled to
generalise.&nbsp; No don, that was a don, could have seen Shelley
or Landor as they are described to us without hastily classing
them in the category of poets who would come to no good and do
little credit to the college.&nbsp; Landor went up to Trinity
College in 1793.&nbsp; It was the dreadful year of the Terror,
when good Englishmen hated the cruel murderers of kings and
queens.&nbsp; Landor was a good Englishman, of course, and he
never forgave the French the public assassination of Marie
Antoinette.&nbsp; But he must needs be a Jacobin, and wear his
own unpowdered hair&mdash;the Poet thus declaring himself at once
in the regular recognised fashion.&nbsp; &lsquo;For a portion of
the time he certainly read hard, but the results he kept to
himself; for here, as at Rugby, he declined everything in the
shape of competition.&rsquo;&nbsp; (Now competition is the
essence of modern University study.)&nbsp; &lsquo;Though I wrote
better Latin verses than any undergraduate or graduate in the
University,&rsquo; says Landor, &lsquo;I could never be persuaded
by my tutor or friends to contend for any prize
whatever.&rsquo;&nbsp; The pleasantest and most profitable hours
that Landor could remember at Oxford &lsquo;were passed with
Walter Birch in the Magdalen Walk, by the half-hidden
Cherwell.&rsquo;&nbsp; Hours like these are indeed the
pleasantest and most profitable that any of us pass at
Oxford.&nbsp; The one duty which that University, by virtue of
its very nature, has never neglected, is the assembling of young
men together from all over England, and giving them three years
of liberty of life, of leisure, and of discussion, in scenes
which are classical and peaceful.&nbsp; For these hours, the most
fruitful of our lives, we are grateful to Oxford, as long as
friendship lives; that is, as long as life and memory remain with
us.&nbsp; And, &lsquo;if anything endure, if hope there
be,&rsquo; our conscious existence in the after-world would ask
for no better companions than those who walked with us by the
Isis and the Cherwell.</p>
<p>Landor called himself &lsquo;a Jacobin,&rsquo; though his own
letters show that he was as far as the most insolent young
&lsquo;tuft&rsquo; from relishing doctrines of human
equality.&nbsp; He had the reputation, however, of being not only
a Jacobin, but &lsquo;a mad Jacobin&rsquo;; too mad for Southey,
who was then young, and a Liberal.&nbsp; &lsquo;Landor was
obliged to leave the University for shooting at one of the
Fellows through a window,&rsquo; is the account which Southey
gave of Landor&rsquo;s rustication.&nbsp; Now fellows often put
up with a great deal of horse-play.&nbsp; There is scarcely a
more touching story than that of the don who for the first time
found himself &lsquo;screwed up,&rsquo; and fastened within his
own oak.&nbsp; &lsquo;What am I to do?&rsquo; the victim asked
his sympathising scout, who was on the other, the free side of
the oak.&nbsp; &lsquo;Well, sir, Mr. Muff, sir, when
&rsquo;e&rsquo;s screwed up &rsquo;e sends for the
blacksmith,&rsquo; replied the servant.&nbsp; What a position for
a man having authority, to be in the constant habit of sending
for the blacksmith!&nbsp; Fellows have not very unfrequently been
fired at with Roman candles, or bombarded with soda-water bottles
full of gunpowder.&nbsp; One has also known sparrows shot from
Balliol windows on the Martyrs&rsquo; Memorial of our
illustration.&nbsp; In this case, too, the sportsman was a
poet.&nbsp; But deliberately to pot at a fellow, &lsquo;to go for
him with a shot gun,&rsquo; as the repentant American said he
would do in future, after his derringer missed fire, is certainly
a strong measure.&nbsp; No college which pretended to maintain
discipline could allow even a poet to shoot thus wildly.&nbsp; In
truth, Landor&rsquo;s offence has been exaggerated by
Southey.&nbsp; It was nothing out of the common.&nbsp; The poet
was giving &lsquo;an after-dinner party&rsquo; in his
rooms.&nbsp; The men were mostly from Christ Church; for Landor
was intimate, he says, with only one undergraduate of his own
college, Trinity.&nbsp; On the opposite side of the quadrangle a
Tory and a butt, named Leeds, was entertaining persons whom the
Jacobin Landor calls &lsquo;servitors and other raff of every
description.&rsquo;&nbsp; The guests at the rival wine-parties
began to &lsquo;row&rsquo; each other, Landor says, adding,
&lsquo;All the time I was only a spectator, for I should have
blushed to have had any conversation with them, particularly out
of a window.&nbsp; But my gun was lying on a table in the room,
and I had in a back closet some little shot.&nbsp; I proposed, as
they had closed the casements, and as the shutters were on the
outside, to fire a volley.&nbsp; It was thought a good trick, and
accordingly I went into my bedroom and fired.&rsquo;&nbsp; Mr.
Leeds very superfluously complained to the President.&nbsp;
Landor adopted the worst possible line of defence, and so the
University and this poet parted company.</p>
<p>It seems to have been generally understood that Landor&rsquo;s
affair was a boyish escapade.&nbsp; A copious literature is
engaged with the subject of Shelley&rsquo;s expulsion.&nbsp; As
the story is told by Mr. Hogg, in his delightful book, the
<i>Life of Shelley</i>, that poet&rsquo;s career at Oxford was a
typical one.&nbsp; There are in every generation youths like him,
in unworldliness, wildness, and dreaminess, though unlike him, of
course, in genius.&nbsp; The divine spark has not touched them,
but they, like Shelley, are still of the band whom the world has
not tamed.&nbsp; As Mr. Hogg&rsquo;s book is out of print, and
rare, it would be worth while, did space permit, to reproduce
some of his wonderfully life-like and truthful accounts of Oxford
as she was in 1810.&nbsp; The University has changed in many
ways, and in most ways for the better.&nbsp; Perhaps that old,
indolent, and careless Oxford was better adapted to the life of
such an almost unexampled genius as Shelley.&nbsp; When his Eton
friends asked him whether he still meant to be &lsquo;the
Atheist,&rsquo; that is, the rebel he had been at school, he
said, &lsquo;No; the college authorities were civil, and left him
alone.&rsquo;&nbsp; Let us remember this when the learned
Professor of Poetry at Oxford, Mr. Shairp, calls Shelley
&lsquo;an Atheist.&rsquo;&nbsp; Mr. Hogg sometimes complains that
undergraduates were left too much alone.&nbsp; But who could have
safely advised or securely guided Shelley?</p>
<p>Undergraduates are now more closely looked after, as far as
reading goes, than perhaps they like&mdash;certainly much more
than Shelley would have liked.&nbsp; But when we turn from study
to the conduct of life, is it not plain that no <i>official</i>
interference can be of real value?&nbsp; Friendship and
confidence may, and often does, exist between tutors and
pupils.&nbsp; There are tutors so happily gifted with sympathy,
and with a kind of eternal youth of heart and intellect, that
they become the friends of generation after generation of
freshmen.&nbsp; This is fortunate; but who can wonder that
middle-aged men, seeing the generations succeed and resemble each
other, lose their powers of understanding, of directing, of
aiding the young, who are thus cast at once on their own
resources?&nbsp; One has occasionally heard clever men complain
that they were neglected by their seniors, that their hearts and
brains were full of perilous stuff, which no one helped them to
unpack.&nbsp; And it is true that modern education, when it meets
the impatience of youth, often produces an unhappy ferment in the
minds of men.&nbsp; To put it shortly, clever students have to go
through their age of <i>Sturm und Drang</i>, and they are
sometimes disappointed when older people, their tutors, for
example, do not help them to weather the storm.&nbsp; It is a
tempest in which every one must steer for himself, after all; and
Shelley &lsquo;was borne darkly, fearfully afar,&rsquo; into
unplumbed seas of thought and experience.&nbsp; When Mr. Hogg
complains that his friend was too much left to himself to study
and think as he pleased, let us remember that no one could have
helped Shelley.&nbsp; He was better at Oxford without his old Dr.
Lind, &lsquo;with whom he used to curse George <span
class="GutSmall">III.</span> after tea.&rsquo;</p>

<p>There are few chapters in literary history more fascinating
than those which tell the story of Shelley at Oxford.&nbsp; We
see him entering the hall of University College&mdash;a tall, shy
stripling, bronzed with the September sun, with long
elf-locks.&nbsp; He takes his seat by a stranger, and in a moment
holds him spell-bound, while he talks of Plato, and Goethe, and
Alfieri, of Italian poetry, and Greek philosophy.&nbsp; Mr. Hogg
draws a curious sketch of Shelley at work in his rooms, where
seven-shilling pieces were being dissolved in acid in the
teacups, where there was a great hole in the floor that the poet
had burned with his chemicals.&nbsp; The one-eyed scout,
&lsquo;the Arimaspian,&rsquo; must have had a time of tribulation
(being a conscientious and fatherly man) with this odd
master.&nbsp; How characteristic of Shelley it was to lend the
glow of his fancy to science, to declare that things, not
thoughts, mineralogy, not literature, must occupy human minds for
the future, and then to leave a lecture on mineralogy in the
middle, and admit that &lsquo;stones are dull things after
all!&rsquo;&nbsp; Not less Shelleyan was the adventure on
Magdalen Bridge, the beautiful bridge of our illustration, from
which Oxford, with the sunset behind it, looks like a fairy city
of the Arabian Nights&mdash;a town of palaces and princesses,
rather than of proctors.</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;One Sunday we had been reading Plato
together so diligently, that the usual hour of exercise passed
away unperceived: we sallied forth hastily to take the air for
half-an-hour before dinner.&nbsp; In the middle of Magdalen
Bridge we met a woman with a child in her arms.&nbsp; Shelley was
more attentive at that instant to our conduct in a life that was
past, or to come, than to a decorous regulation of the present,
according to the established usages of society, in that fleeting
moment of eternal duration styled the nineteenth century.&nbsp;
With abrupt dexterity he caught hold of the child.&nbsp; The
mother, who might well fear that it was about to be thrown over
the parapet of the bridge into the sedgy waters below, held it
fast by its long train.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Will your baby tell us anything about
pre-existence, Madam?&rdquo; he asked, in a piercing voice, and
with a wistful look.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Shelley and Hogg seem almost to have lived in reality the life
of the Scholar Gipsy.&nbsp; In Mr. Arnold&rsquo;s poem, which has
made permanent for all time the charm, the sentiment of
Oxfordshire scenery, the poet seems to be following the track of
Shelley.&nbsp; In Mr. Hogg&rsquo;s memoirs we hear little of
summer; it seems always to have been in winter that the friends
took their long rambles, in which Shelley set free, in talk, his
inspiration.&nbsp; One thinks of him</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;in
winter, on the causeway chill,<br />
Where home through flooded fields foot travellers go,&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>returning to the supper in Hogg&rsquo;s rooms, to the curious
desultory meals, the talk, and the deep slumber by the roaring
fire, the small head lying perilously near the flames.&nbsp; One
would not linger here over the absurd injustice of his expulsion
from the University.&nbsp; It is pleasant to know, on Mr.
Hogg&rsquo;s testimony, that &lsquo;residence at Oxford was
exceedingly delightful to Shelley, and on all accounts most
beneficial.&rsquo;&nbsp; At Oxford, at least, he seems to have
been happy, he who so rarely knew happiness, and who, if he made
another suffer, himself suffered so much for others.&nbsp; The
memory of Shelley has deeply entered into the sentiment of
Oxford.&nbsp; Thinking of him in his glorious youth, and of his
residence here, may we not say, with the shepherd in Theocritus,
of the divine singer:</p>

191</span>CHAPTER IX<br />
<span class="GutSmall">A GENERAL VIEW</span></h1>
<p><span class="smcap">We</span> have looked at Oxford life in so
many different periods, that now, perhaps, we may regard it, like
our artist, as a whole, and take a bird&rsquo;s-eye view of its
present condition.&nbsp; We may ask St. Bernard&rsquo;s question,
<i>Whither hast thou come</i>? a question to which there are so
many answers readily given, from within and without the
University.&nbsp; It is not probable that the place will vary, in
essential character, from that which has all along been its
own.&nbsp; We shall have considered Oxford to very little
purpose, if it is not plain that the University has been less a
home of learning, on the whole, than a microcosm of English
intellectual life.&nbsp; At Oxford the men have been thinking
what England was to think a few months later, and they have been
thinking with the passion and the energy of youth.&nbsp; The
impulse to thought has not, perhaps, very often been given by any
mind or minds within the college walls; it has come from
without&mdash;from Italy, from France, from London, from a
country vicarage, perhaps, from the voice of a wandering
preacher.&nbsp; Whencesoever the leaven came, Oxford (being so
small, and in a way so homogeneous) has always fermented readily,
and promptly distributed the new forces, religious or
intellectual, throughout England.</p>
<p>It is characteristic of England that the exciting topics, the
questions that move the people most, have always been religious,
or deeply tinctured with religion.&nbsp; Conservative as Oxford
is, the home of &lsquo;impossible causes,&rsquo; she has always
given asylum to new doctrines, to all the thoughts which
comfortable people call &lsquo;dangerous.&rsquo;&nbsp; We have
seen her agitated by Lollardism, which never quite died, perhaps,
till its eager protest against the sacerdotal ideal was fused
into the fire of the Reformation.&nbsp; Oxford was literally
devastated by that movement, and by the Catholic reaction, and
then was disturbed for a century and a half by the war of
Puritanism, and of Tory Anglicanism.&nbsp; The latter had
scarcely had time to win the victory, and to fall into a doze by
her pipe of port, when Evangelical religion came to vex all that
was moderate, mature, and fond of repose.&nbsp; The revolutionary
enthusiasm of Shelley&rsquo;s time was comparatively feeble,
because it had no connection with religion; or, at least, no
connection with the religion to which our countrymen were
accustomed.&nbsp; Between the era of the Revolution and our own
day, two religious tempests and one secular storm of thought have
swept over Oxford, and the University is at present, if one may
say so, like a ship in a heavy swell, the sea looking much more
tranquil than it really is.</p>
<p>The Tractarian movement was, of course, the first of the
religious disturbances to which we refer, and much the most
powerful.</p>
<p>It is curious to read about that movement in the
<i>Apologia</i>, for example, of Cardinal Newman.&nbsp; On what
singular topics men&rsquo;s minds were bent! what queer survivals
of the speculations of the Schools agitated them as they walked
round Christ Church meadows!&nbsp; They enlightened each other on
things transcendental, yet material, on matters unthinkable, and,
properly speaking, unspeakable.&nbsp; It is as if they
&lsquo;spoke with tongues,&rsquo; which had a meaning then, and
for them, but which to us, some forty years later, seem as
meaningless as the inscriptions of Easter Island.</p>

</a></p>
<p>This was the shape, the Tractarian movement was the shape, in
which the great Romantic reaction laid hold on England and
Oxford.&nbsp; The father of all the revival of old doctrines and
old rituals in our Church, the originator of that wistful return
to things beautiful and long dead, was&mdash;Walter Scott.&nbsp;
Without him, and his wonderful wand which made the dry bones of
history live, England and France would not have known this
picturesque reaction.&nbsp; The stir in these two countries was
curiously characteristic of their genius.&nbsp; In France it put
on, in the first place, the shape of art, of poetry, painting,
sculpture.&nbsp; Romanticism blossomed in 1830, and bore fruit
for ten years.&nbsp; The religious reaction was a punier thing;
the great Abb&eacute;, who was the Newman of France, was himself
unable to remain within the fantastic church that he built out of
medieval ruins.&nbsp; In England, and especially in Oxford, the
&aelig;sthetic admiration of the Past was promptly transmuted
into religion.&nbsp; Doctrines which men thought dead were
resuscitated; and from Oxford came, not poetry or painting, but
the sermons of Newman, the <i>Tracts</i>, the whole religious
force which has transformed and revivified the Church of
England.&nbsp; That force is still working, it need hardly be
said, in the University of to-day, under conditions much changed,
but not without thrills of the old volcanic energy.</p>
<p>Probably the Anglican ideas ceased to be the most powerfully
agitating of intellectual forces in Oxford about 1845.&nbsp; A
new current came in from Rugby, and the influence of Dr. Arnold
and the natural tide of reaction began to run very strong.&nbsp;
If we had the <i>apologi&aelig;</i> of the men who thought most,
about the time when Clough was an undergraduate, we should see
that the influence of the Anglican divines had become a thing of
sentiment and curiosity.&nbsp; The life had not died out of it,
but the people whom it could permanently affect were now limited
in number and easily recognisable.&nbsp; This form of religion
might tempt and attract the strongest men for a while, but it
certainly would not retain them.&nbsp; It is by this time a
matter of history, though we are speaking of our contemporaries,
that the abyss between the <i>Lives of the English Saints</i>,
and the <i>Nemesis of Faith</i>, was narrow, and easily
crossed.&nbsp; There was in Oxford that enthusiasm for certain
German ideas which had previously been felt for medieval
ideas.&nbsp; Liberalism in history, philosophy, and religion was
the ruling power; and people believed in Liberalism.&nbsp; What
is, or used to be, called the Broad Church, was the birth of some
ten or fifteen years of Liberalism in religion at Oxford.&nbsp;
The <i>Essays and Reviews</i> were what the <i>Tracts</i> had
been; and Homeric battles were fought over the income of the
Regius Professor of Greek.&nbsp; When that affair was settled
Liberalism had had her innings, there was no longer a single
dominant intellectual force; but the old storms, slowly
subsiding, left the ship of the University lurching and rolling
in a heavy swell.</p>
<p>People believed in Liberalism!&nbsp; Their faith worked
miracles; and the great University Commission performed many
wonderful works, bidding close fellowships be open, and giving
all power into the hands of Examiners.&nbsp; Their dispensation
still survives; the large examining-machine works night and day,
in term time and vacation, and yet we are not happy.&nbsp; The
age in Oxford, as in the world at large, is the age of collapsed
opinions.&nbsp; Never men believed more fervidly in any
revelation than the men of twenty years ago believed in political
economy, free trade, open competition, and the reign of
Common-sense and of Mr. Cobden.&nbsp; Where is that faith
now?&nbsp; Many of the middle-aged disciples of the Church of
Common-sense are still in our midst.&nbsp; They say the old
sayings, they intone the old responses, but somehow it seems that
scepticism is abroad; it seems that the world is wider than their
system.&nbsp; Not even open examinations for fellowships and
scholarships, not half a dozen new schools, and science, and the
Museum, and the Slade Professorship of Art, have made Oxford that
ideal University which was expected to come down from Heaven like
the New Jerusalem.</p>
<p>We have glanced at the history of Oxford to little purpose if
we have not learned that it is an eminently discontented
place.&nbsp; There is room in colleges and common rooms for both
sorts of discontent&mdash;the ignoble, which is the child of
vanity and weakness; and the noble, which is the unassuaged
thirst for perfection.&nbsp; The present result of the last forty
years in Oxford is a discontent which is constantly trying to
improve the working, and to widen the intellectual influence, of
the University.&nbsp; There are more ways than one in which this
feeling gets vent.&nbsp; The simplest, and perhaps the most
honest and worthy impulse, is that which makes the best of the
present arrangements.&nbsp; Great religious excitement and
religious discussion being in abeyance, for once, the energy of
the place goes out in teaching.&nbsp; The last reforms have made
Oxford a huge collection of schools, in which physical science,
history, philosophy, philology, scholarship, theology, and almost
everything in the world but arch&aelig;ology, are being taught
and learned with very great vigour.&nbsp; The hardest worked of
men is a conscientious college tutor; and almost all tutors are
conscientious.&nbsp; The professors being an ornamental, but
(with few exceptions) <i>merely</i> ornamental, order of beings,
the tutors have to do the work of a University, which, for the
moment, is a teaching-machine.&nbsp; They deliver I know not how
many sets of lectures a year, and each lecture demands a fresh
and full acquaintance with the latest ideas of French, German,
and Italian scholars.&nbsp; No one can afford, or is willing, to
lag behind; every one is &lsquo;gladly learning,&rsquo; like
Chaucer&rsquo;s clerk, as well as earnestly teaching.&nbsp; The
knowledge and the industry of these gentlemen is a perpetual
marvel to the &lsquo;bellelettristic trifler.&rsquo;&nbsp; New
studies, like that of Celtic, and of the obscurer Oriental
tongues, have sprung up during recent years, have grown into
strength and completeness.&nbsp; It is unnecessary to say,
perhaps, that these facts dispose of the popular idea about the
luxury of the long vacation.&nbsp; During the more part of the
long vacation the conscientious teacher must be toiling after the
great mundane movement in learning.&nbsp; He must be acquiring
the very freshest ideas about Sanscrit and Greek; about the Ogham
characters and the Cyprian syllabary; about early Greek
inscriptions and the origins of Roman history, in addition to
reading the familiar classics by the light of the latest
commentaries.</p>

</a></p>
<p>What is the tangible result, and what the gain of all these
labours?&nbsp; The answer is the secret of University
discontent.&nbsp; All this accumulated knowledge goes out in
teaching, is scattered abroad in lectures, is caught up in
note-books, and is poured out, with a difference, in
examinations.&nbsp; There is not an amount of original literary
work produced by the University which bears any due proportion to
the solid materials accumulated.&nbsp; It is just the reverse of
Falstaff&rsquo;s case&mdash;but one halfpenny-worth of sack to an
intolerable deal of bread; but a drop of the spirit of learning
to cart-loads of painfully acquired knowledge.&nbsp; The time and
energy of men is occupied in amassing facts, in lecturing, and
then in eternal examinations.&nbsp; Even if the results are
satisfactory on the whole, even if a hundred well-equipped young
men are turned out of the examining-machine every year, these
arrangements certainly curb individual ambition.&nbsp; If a
resident in Oxford is to make an income that seems adequate, he
must lecture, examine, and write manuals and primers, till he is
grey, and till the energy that might have added something new and
valuable to the acquisitions of the world has departed.</p>
<p>This state of things has produced the demand for the
&lsquo;Endowment of Research.&rsquo;&nbsp; It is not necessary to
go into that controversy.&nbsp; Englishmen, as a rule, believe
that endowed cats catch no mice.&nbsp; They would rather endow a
theatre than a <i>Gelehrter</i>, if endow something they
must.&nbsp; They have a British sympathy with these beautiful, if
useless beings, the heads of houses, whom it would be necessary
to abolish if Researchers were to get the few tens of thousands
they require.&nbsp; Finally, it is asked whether the learned
might not find great endowment in economy; for it is a fact that
a Frenchman, a German, or an Italian will &lsquo;research&rsquo;
for life on no larger income than a simple fellowship
bestows.</p>
<p>The great obstacle to this &lsquo;plain living&rsquo; is
perhaps to be found in the traditional hospitality of
Oxford.&nbsp; All her doors are open, and every stranger is
kindly entreated by her, and she is like the &lsquo;discreet
housewife&rsquo; in Homer&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align:
center">&epsilon;&#7988;&delta;&alpha;&tau;&alpha;
&pi;&#8057;&lambda;&lambda;&rsquo;
&#7952;&pi;&iota;&theta;&epsilon;&#8150;&sigma;&alpha;,
&chi;&alpha;&rho;&iota;&zeta;&omicron;&mu;&#8051;&nu;&eta;
&pi;&alpha;&rho;&epsilon;&#8057;&nu;&tau;&omega;&nu;.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In some languages the same word serves for
&lsquo;stranger&rsquo; and &lsquo;enemy,&rsquo; but in the Oxford
dialect &lsquo;stranger&rsquo; and &lsquo;guest&rsquo; are
synonymous.&nbsp; Such is the custom of the place, and it does
not make plain living very easy.&nbsp; Some critics will be
anxious here to attack the &lsquo;&aelig;sthetic&rsquo;
movement.&nbsp; One will be expected to say that, after the ideas
of Newman, after the ideas of Arnold, and of Jowett, came those
of the wicked, the extravagant, the effeminate, the immoral
&lsquo;Blue China School.&rsquo;&nbsp; Perhaps there is something
in this, but sermons on the subject are rather luxuries than
necessaries in the present didactic mood of the Press.&nbsp;
&lsquo;They were friends of ours, moreover,&rsquo; as Aristotle
says, &lsquo;who brought these ideas in&rsquo;; so the subject
may be left with this brief notice.&nbsp; As a piece of practical
advice, one may warn the young and ardent advocate of the
Endowment of Research that he will find it rather easier to
curtail his expenses than to get a subsidy from the
Commission.</p>
<p>The last important result of the &lsquo;modern spirit&rsquo;
at Oxford, the last stroke of the sanguine Liberal genius, was
the removal of the celibate condition from certain
fellowships.&nbsp; One can hardly take a bird&rsquo;s-eye view of
Oxford without criticising the consequences of this
innovation.&nbsp; The topic, however, is, for a dozen reasons,
very difficult to handle.&nbsp; One reason is, that the
experiment has not been completely tried.&nbsp; It is easy enough
to marry on a fellowship, a tutorship, and a few small
miscellaneous offices.&nbsp; But how will it be when you come to
forty years, or even fifty?&nbsp; No materials exist which can be
used by the social philosopher who wants an answer to this
question.&nbsp; In the meantime, the common rooms are perhaps
more dreary than of old, in many a college, for lack of the
presence of men now translated to another place.&nbsp; As to the
&lsquo;society&rsquo; of Oxford, that is, no doubt, very much
more charming and vivacious than it used to be in the days when
Tony Wood was the surly champion of celibacy.</p>
<p>Looking round the University, then, one finds in it an
activity that would once have seemed almost feverish, a highly
conscientious industry, doing that which its hand finds to do,
but not absolutely certain that it is not neglecting nobler
tasks.&nbsp; Perhaps Oxford has never been more busy with its own
work, never less distracted by religious politics.&nbsp; If we
are to look for a less happy sign, we shall find it in the
tendency to run up &lsquo;new buildings.&rsquo;&nbsp; The
colleges are landowners: they must suffer with other owners of
real property in the present depression; they will soon need all
their savings.&nbsp; That is one reason why they should be chary
of building; another is, that the fellows of a college at any
given moment are not necessarily endowed with architectural
knowledge and taste.&nbsp; They should think twice, or even
thrice, before leaving on Oxford for many centuries the uncomely
mark of an unfortunate judgment.</p>

209</span>CHAPTER X<br />
<span class="GutSmall">UNDERGRADUATE
LIFE&mdash;CONCLUSION</span></h2>
<p>A <span class="smcap">hundred</span> pictures have been drawn
of undergraduate life at Oxford, and a hundred caricatures.&nbsp;
Novels innumerable introduce some Oxford scenes.&nbsp; An author
generally writes his first romance soon after taking his degree;
he writes about his own experience and his own memories; he mixes
his ingredients at will and tints according to fancy.&nbsp; This
is one of the two reasons why pictures of Oxford, from the
undergraduate side, are generally false.&nbsp; They are either
drawn by an aspirant who is his own hero, and who idealises
himself and his friends, or they are designed by ladies who have
read <i>Verdant Green</i>, and who, at some period, have paid a
flying visit to Cambridge.&nbsp; An exhaustive knowledge of
<i>Verdant Green</i>, and a hasty view of the Fitzwilliam Museum
and &lsquo;the backs of the Colleges&rsquo; (which are to
Cambridge what the Docks are to Liverpool), do not afford
sufficient materials for an accurate sketch of Oxford.&nbsp; The
picture daubed by the emancipated undergraduate who dabbles in
fiction is as unrecognisable.&nbsp; He makes himself and his
friends too large, too noisy, too bibulous, too learned, too
extravagant, too pugnacious.&nbsp; They seem to stride down the
High, prodigious, disproportionate figures, like the kings of
Egypt on the monuments, overshadowing the crowd of dons,
tradesmen, bargees, and cricket-field or river-side cads.&nbsp;
Often one dimly recognises the scenes, and the acquaintances of
years ago, in University novels.&nbsp; The mildest of men
suddenly pose as heroes of the Guy Livingstone type, fellows who
&lsquo;screw up&rsquo; timid dons, box with colossal watermen,
and read all night with wet towels bound round their fevered
brows.&nbsp; These sketches are all nonsense.&nbsp; Men who do
these things do not write about them; and men who write about
them never did them.</p>
<p>There is yet another cause which increases the difficulty of
describing undergraduate life with truth.&nbsp; There are very
many varieties of undergraduates, who have very various ways of
occupying and amusing themselves.&nbsp; A steady man that reads
his five or six hours a day, and takes his pastime chiefly on the
river, finds that his path scarcely ever crosses that of him who
belongs to the Bullingdon Club, hunts thrice a week, and rarely
dines in hall.&nbsp; Then the &lsquo;pale student,&rsquo; who is
hard at work in his rooms or in the Bodleian all day, and who has
only two friends, out-college men, with whom he takes walks and
tea,&mdash;he sees existence in a very different aspect.&nbsp;
The Union politician, who is for ever hanging about his club,
dividing the house on questions of blotting-paper and quill pens,
discussing its affairs at breakfast, intriguing for the place of
Librarian, writing rubbish in the suggestion-book, to him Oxford
is only a soil carefully prepared for the growth of that fine
flower, the Union.&nbsp; He never encounters the undergraduate
who haunts billiard-rooms and shy taverns, who buys jewelry for
barmaids, and who is admired for the audacity with which he
smuggled a fox-terrier into college in a brown-paper
parcel.&nbsp; There are many other species of undergraduate,
scarcely more closely resembling each other in manners and modes
of thought than the little Japanese student resembles the
metaphysical Scotch exhibitioner, or than the hereditary war
minister of Siam (whose career, though brief, was vivacious)
resembled the Exeter Sioux, a half-reclaimed savage, who
disappeared on the warpath after failing to scalp the Junior
Proctor.&nbsp; When The Wet Blanket returned to his lodge in the
land of Sitting Bull, he doubtless described Oxford life in his
own way to the other Braves, while the squaws hung upon his words
and the papooses played around.&nbsp; His account would vary, in
many ways, from that of</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Whiskered Tomkins from the hall<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of seedy Magdalene.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And he, again, would not see Oxford life steadily, and see it
whole, as a more cultivated and polished undergraduate
might.&nbsp; Thus there are countless pictures of the works and
ways of undergraduates at the University.&nbsp; The scene is ever
the same&mdash;boat-races and foot-ball matches, scouts, schools,
and proctors, are common to all,&mdash;but in other respects the
sketches must always vary, must generally be one-sided, and must
often seem inaccurate.</p>
<p>It appears that a certain romance is attached to the three
years that are passed between the estate of the freshman and that
of the Bachelor of Arts.&nbsp; These years are spent in a kind of
fairyland, neither quite within nor quite outside of the
world.&nbsp; College life is somewhat, as has so often been said,
like the old Greek city life.&nbsp; For three years men are in
the possession of what the world does not enjoy&mdash;leisure;
and they are supposed to be using that leisure for the purposes
of perfection.&nbsp; They are making themselves and their
characters.&nbsp; We are all doing that, all the days of our
lives; but at the Universities there is, or is expected to be,
more deliberate and conscious effort.&nbsp; Men are in a position
to &lsquo;try all things&rsquo; before committing themselves to
any.&nbsp; Their new-found freedom does not merely consist in the
right to poke their own fires, order their own breakfasts, and
use their own cheque-books.&nbsp; These things, which make so
much impression on the mind at first, are only the outward signs
of freedom.&nbsp; The boy who has just left school, and the
thoughtless life of routine in work and play, finds himself in
the midst of books, of thought, and discussion.&nbsp; He has time
to look at all the common problems of the hour, and yet he need
not make up his mind hurriedly, nor pledge himself to
anything.&nbsp; He can flirt with young opinions, which come to
him with candid faces, fresh as Queen Entelechy in Rabelais,
though, like her, they are as old as human thought.&nbsp; Here
first he meets Metaphysics, and perhaps falls in love with that
enchantress, &lsquo;who sifts time with a fine large blue silk
sieve.&rsquo;&nbsp; There is hardly a clever lad but fancies
himself a metaphysician, and has designs on the Absolute.&nbsp;
Most fall away very early from this, their first love; and they
follow Science down one of her many paths, or concern themselves
with politics, and take a side which, as a rule, is the opposite
of that to which they afterwards adhere.&nbsp; Thus your
Christian Socialist becomes a Court preacher, and puts his trust
in princes; the young Tory of the old type will lapse into
membership of a School Board.&nbsp; It is the time of liberty,
and of intellectual attachments too fierce to last long.</p>
<p>Unluckily there are subjects more engrossing, and problems
more attractive, than politics, and science, art, and pure
metaphysics.&nbsp; The years of undergraduate life are those in
which, to many men, the enigmas of religion present
themselves.&nbsp; They bring their boyish faith into a place (if
one may quote Pantagruel&rsquo;s voyage once more) like the Isle
of the Macraeones.&nbsp; On that mournful island were confusedly
heaped the ruins of altars, fanes, temples, shrines, sacred
obelisks, barrows of the dead, pyramids, and tombs.&nbsp; Through
the ruins wandered, now and again, the half-articulate words of
the Oracle, telling how Pan was dead.&nbsp; Oxford, like the Isle
of the Macraeones, is a lumber-room of ruinous philosophies,
decrepit religions, forlorn beliefs.&nbsp; The modern system of
study takes the pupil through all the philosophic and many of the
religious systems of belief, which, in the distant and the nearer
past, have been fashioned by men, and have sheltered men for a
day.&nbsp; You are taught to mark each system crumbling, to watch
the rise of the new temple of thought on its ruins, and to see
that also perish, breached by assaults from without or sapped by
the slow approaches of Time.&nbsp; This is not the place in which
we can well discuss the merits of modern University
education.&nbsp; But no man can think of his own University days,
or look with sympathetic eyes at those who fill the old halls and
rooms, and not remember, with a twinge of the old pain, how
religious doubt insists on thrusting itself into the
colleges.&nbsp; And it is fair to say that, for this, no set of
teachers or tutors is responsible.&nbsp; It is the modern
historical spirit that must be blamed, that too clear-sighted
vision which we are all condemned to share of the past of the
race.&nbsp; We are compelled to look back on old philosophies, on
India, Athens, Alexandria, and on the schools of men who thought
so hard within our own ancient walls.&nbsp; We are compelled to
see that their systems were only plausible, that their truths
were but half-truths.&nbsp; It is the long vista of failure thus
revealed which suggests these doubts that weary, and torture, and
embitter the naturally happy life of discussion, amusement,
friendship, sport, and study.&nbsp; These doubts, after all,
dwell on the threshold of modern existence, and on the
threshold&mdash;namely, at the Universities&mdash;men subdue
them, or evade them.</p>
<p>The amusements of the University have been so often described
that little need be said of them here.&nbsp; Unhealthy as the
site of Oxford is, the place is rather fortunately disposed for
athletic purposes.&nbsp; The river is the chief feature in the
scenery, and in the life of amusement.&nbsp; From the first day
of term, in October, it is crowded with every sort of
craft.&nbsp; The freshman admires the golden colouring of the
woods and Magdalen tower rising, silvery, through the blue
autumnal haze.&nbsp; As soon as he appears on the river, his
weight, strength, and &lsquo;form&rsquo; are estimated.&nbsp; He
soon finds himself pulling in a college &lsquo;challenge
four,&rsquo; under the severe eye of a senior cox, and by the
middle of December he has rowed his first race, and is regularly
entered for a serious vocation.&nbsp; The thorough-going
boating-man is the creature of habit.&nbsp; Every day, at the
same hour, after a judicious luncheon, he is seen, in flannels,
making for the barge.&nbsp; He goes out, in a skiff, or a pair,
or a four-oar, or to a steeplechase through the hedges when
Oxford, as in our illustration, is under water.&nbsp; The
illustration represents Merton, and the writer recognises his old
rooms, with the Venetian blinds which Mr. Ruskin denounced.&nbsp;
Chief of all the boating-man goes out in an eight, and rows down
to Iffley, with the beautiful old mill and Norman church, or
accomplishes &lsquo;the long course.&rsquo;&nbsp; He rows up
again, lounges in the barge, rows down again (if he has only
pulled over the short course), and goes back to dinner in
hall.&nbsp; The table where men sit who are in training is a
noisy table, and the athletes verge on
&lsquo;bear-fighting&rsquo; even in hall.&nbsp; A statistician
might compute how many steaks, chops, pots of beer, and of
marmalade, an orthodox man will consume in the course of three
years.&nbsp; He will, perhaps, pretend to suffer from the
monotony of boating shop, boating society, and broad-blown
boating jokes.&nbsp; But this appears to be a harmless
affectation.&nbsp; The old breakfasts, wines, and suppers, the
honest boating slang, will always have an attraction for
him.&nbsp; The summer term will lose its delight when the May
races are over.&nbsp; Boating-men are the salt of the University,
so steady, so well disciplined, so good-tempered are they.&nbsp;
The sport has nothing selfish or personal in it; men row for
their college, or their University; not like running&mdash;men,
who run, as it were, each for his own hand.&nbsp; Whatever may be
his work in life, a boating-man will stick to it.&nbsp; His
favourite sport is not expensive, and nothing can possibly be
less luxurious.&nbsp; He is often a reading man, though it may be
doubted whether &lsquo;he who runs may read&rsquo; as a
rule.&nbsp; Running is, perhaps, a little overdone, and
Strangers&rsquo; cups are, or lately were, given with injudicious
generosity.&nbsp; To the artist&rsquo;s eye, however, few sights
in modern life are more graceful than the University
quarter-of-a-mile race.&nbsp; Nowhere else, perhaps, do you see
figures so full of a Hellenic grace and swiftness.</p>
<p>The cream of University life is the first summer term.&nbsp;
Debts, as yet, are not; the Schools are too far off to cast their
shadow over the unlimited enjoyment, which begins when lecture is
over, at one o&rsquo;clock.&nbsp; There are so many things to
do,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;When wickets are bowled and defended,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; When Isis is glad with the eights,<br />
When music and sunset are blended,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; When Youth and the Summer are mates,<br />
When freshmen are heedless of &ldquo;Greats,&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; When note-books are scribbled with rhyme,<br />
Ah! these are the hours that one rates<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Sweet hours, and the fleetest of Time!&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are drags at every college gate to take college teams
down to Cowley.&nbsp; There is the beautiful scenery of the
&lsquo;stripling Thames&rsquo; to explore; the haunts of the
immortal &lsquo;Scholar Gipsy,&rsquo; and of Shelley, and of
Clough&rsquo;s Piper, who&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Went in his youth and the sunshine
rejoicing, to Nuneham and Godstowe.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Further afield men seldom go in summer, there is so much to
delight and amuse in Oxford. <a name="citation221"></a><a
href="#footnote221" class="citation">[221]</a>&nbsp; What day can
be happier than that of which the morning is given (after a
lively college breakfast, or a &lsquo;commonising&rsquo; with a
friend) to study, while cricket occupies the afternoon, till
music and sunset fill the grassy stretches above Iffley, and the
college eights flash past among cheering and splashing?&nbsp;
Then there is supper in the cool halls, darkling, and half-lit
up; and after supper talk, till the birds twitter in the elms,
and the roofs and the chapel spire look unfamiliar in the blue of
dawn.&nbsp; How long the days were then! almost like the days of
childhood; how distinct is the impression all experience used to
make!&nbsp; In later seasons Care is apt to mount the college
staircase, and the &lsquo;oak&rsquo; which Shelley blessed cannot
keep out this visitor.&nbsp; She comes in many a shape&mdash;as
debt, and doubt, and melancholy; and often she comes as
bereavement.&nbsp; Life and her claims wax importunate; to many
men the Schools mean a cruel and wearing anxiety, out of all
proportion to the real importance of academic success.&nbsp; We
cannot see things as they are, and estimate their value, in
youth; and if pleasures are more keen then, grief is more
hopeless, doubt more desolate, uncertainty more gnawing, than in
later years, when we have known and survived a good deal of the
worst of mortal experience.&nbsp; Often on men still in their
pupilage the weight of the first misfortunes falls heavily; the
first touch of Dame Fortune&rsquo;s whip is the most
poignant.&nbsp; We cannot recover the first summer term; but it
has passed into ourselves and our memories, into which Oxford,
with her beauty and her romance, must also quickly pass.&nbsp; He
is not to be envied who has known and does not love her.&nbsp;
Where her children have quarrelled with her the fault is theirs,
not hers.&nbsp; They have chosen the accidental evils to brood
on, in place of acquiescing in her grace and charm.&nbsp; These
are crowded and hustled out of modern life; the fever and the
noise of our struggles fill all the land, leaving still, at the
Universities, peace, beauty, and leisure.</p>
<p>If any word in these papers has been unkindly said, it has
only been spoken, I hope, of the busybodies who would make Oxford
cease to be herself; who would rob her of her loveliness and her
repose.</p>

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate

Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org 

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary 
Archive Foundation

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
